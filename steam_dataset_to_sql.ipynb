         "Star Realms has gone insane! Introducing Cthulhu Realms! Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

         "Sometimes there is nothing better than a tourney in a classic battleships game. You can see a beautifully designed sea battle, familiar to those from your school times. You have to play against the computer and you need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed. Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.",

         "Steam Squad - tactical wargame, where gameplay takes place at the alternative universe with steampunk details during the times of the Great War amongst colorful anime like settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself. Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting. Your support and feedback is vital for us as they help us to improve and make game even better.",

         "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",

         "“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",

         "It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before. And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!",

         "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

         "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes",

         "Thrillville™: Off the Rails lives up to its name with 20 death-defying rides so outrageous, they inspire the same word from every park visitor who sees them: “WHOA!” Players build these incredible “WHOA Coasters” to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning ring of fire and more. But the new fun doesn’t stop there. Off the Rails features 34 playable multiplayer minigames, 15 all-new theme areas, over 40 thrill rides, a new story that ties together more than 100 missions, and social interaction with park guests that’s better than ever. The in-depth conversations both advance the plot and suggest better ways to manage the park. But is every guest to be trusted? Experience the visceral fun of interacting with a theme park you create. Build and ride your own creations, talk and joke with all your guests, and play dozens of minigames. Visit 15 themed areas, like Battleville, Winterville, Spaceville and Aeroville, all spread throughout five new parks. Create 20 death-defying WHOA Coasters such as: Hotrod Stunt - A nitro boost propels a car across a broken track. Pendulizer - A giant arm grabs the car just before a gap in the track, whips it around in a full circle, then sets it down on the other side. Escape Drop - The track holds the car stationary as it lifts itself from level ground to a full 90-degree drop. Then it lets go. Distinguish your rides even more with enhanced customization options. Attach animatronics, flowers and flaming hoops to all of your coasters and rides. Play 34 minigames – 14 new, 20 returning from the original Thrillville but with new levels.",

As a global organization, The Black Watchmen offer a wide range of skills and services for covert missions anywhere in the world, on behalf of any group, corporation or government that can afford them. Often called in as a last resort, The Black Watchmen pride themselves on their discretion, strength and efficiency. To maintain objectivity in the field, you, as an agent, are never informed of the identity of the client. You are given only mission parameters and told how to distinguish friend from foe, but the lines are often blurred… Gameplay Features Gameplay: Different missions require different skill-sets. Crack ancient codes and investigate bizarre occurrences Join a squadron of soldiers raiding a rupture site Hack through the virtual defenses of your enemies Research an occult group and uncover hidden connections All Around You: The game is played using coded websites, wikis and real world references.

         "It's September 1, 1986. You take on the role of forty-something Meredith Weiss, who returns from the big city to her quiet hometown. She exchanges her busy career at a software company to fill in for her dad, the local mail carrier. During her two-week stay in beautiful Providence Oaks, Oregon, she runs into a few familiar faces as well as plenty of new folk. As Meredith, you get to decide who to talk to, who to befriend and perhaps even start a romantic relationship with. Whatever happens, at the end of her stint she'll have to make up her mind: return to her demanding job in the big city, or stay in the town she grew up in? Play Lake and… Escape to a beautiful, rustic environment without cellphones and the Internet. Drive around the lake in your dad's trusty mail truck, or let the auto-pilot do the work. Talk to a range of engaging characters, each with their own personalities and quirks. Choose after-work activities: hang out with your friends, help out your neighbours or stay home and read a book. Experience two weeks of branching story that doesn't shy away from slice-of-life themes. Determine your own story: there are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers or endings, simply what you want to happen.",

While in-game you have four specials per run, of which three can be chosen from the select menu whereas the last one (the most powerful one) is locked. A particular type of specials are 'Allies'.

         "1984 Rewired is a first-person platformer set in a dystopian society in which the Great Warden controls everything and everyone. The main source of his power is the Cyber Reality , a super network where every citizen has his own digital identity. Thanks to this network the Great Warden can reach anyone with his propaganda and keep his control on everything. The Great Warden grants security, wealth, prosperity, but he took freedom in exchange. ' Freedom is weakness, abiding rules makes us stronger ' . You, an hacker called N4M3L35S.1 , will have to hack your way through the Cyber Reality to expose the truth behind the Great Warden and his regime. But, be aware, the Great Warden is always watching, you have to be quick and run through the network before the security system detects you. The deeper you dig into the Cyber Reality , the harder is going to be your path. This is an hardcore challenge and it will require speed, perfect timing and fast reaction in order to avoid the defensive systems and reach the exit before the time runs out. Test your skills trying to complete every level as quick as possible, look for shortcuts and alternative paths. And if you are up to an extra challenge look for the hidden VHS , there is one in every level. Features Hardcore Fast Pace Gameplay 84 unique levels with tons of traps and puzzles 10 original music tracks with 80s vibes by Fatal Fe and Zombie Sam 4 special powers to make your way through the levels Speedrun mode for an hardcore challenge Steam leaderboard to push your skills to the limit",

         "Rocket Blasters is a fast paced, action packed space themed shoot-em-up. Rack up points by destroying asteroids and enemies on your trip through the stars. Gameplay There is nothing too deep going on here, blow up asteroids, enemy spaceships and occasional bosses in your very own super awesome rocket ship. Get a variety of upgraded weapons in order to help blow up more asteroids, enemy spaceships ... you get the idea. Find out if you have the right stuff to get on (and stay on) the Rocket Blasters Steam Leaderboards! Unique Scoring System Rocket Blasters has a unique system that rewards precision and restraint while blowing stuff up. Each time you fire your weapon, you lose a point, that's right, you lose a point for shooting. However, each time you hit something, you will get 2 or more points back, depending on what you hit. Spamming bullets may be easier, but it will not get you the high score. Check your score on the Steam Global Leader Boards! The Dread Pizza Armada in all its glory Enemies Asteroids are not the only obstacle your rocket will encounter along the way. The Dread Pizza Armada is planning an attack on Earth, and you must destroy as many of their drones as possible. Drones You will encounter many of these dangerous robot ships on your journey. Avoid them, and their lasers, or suffer a painful demise. Shooting them will earn you more points than blasting asteroids, so thinking strategically about what you shoot will help you raise your score. Pizza Armada Battleships The Dread Pizza Armada was named after these oddly shaped triangular battleships. Be careful of lingering behind them, as they have a dangerous array of lasers aimed right at you! Colossal Dreadnoughts The Colossal Dreadnought is the rarest and most dangerous ship in the Armada. Huge and heavily armored, your rocket will have to be quick to avoid its dreaded Annihilation Beam, which destroys everything in its path, including asteroids, your rocket and even its own drones. Finding its weak spot will be key in overcoming this deadly foe. Battling a Pizza Armada Dreadnought Upgrades Your rocket starts with a simple laser blaster, however, as you progress through the game, you may find some useful, temporary upgrades along the way. Look for the floating upgrade gear, and simply fly into it in order to upgrade your rocket. Upgrades have a time limit, indicated by the numbers that appear above your rocket on the screen. Triple Blasters Two extra lasers allow you to clear a path through obstacles and enemies much more efficiently than the single cannon you start with. Side Cannons Side Cannons allow you to slip past enemies and dangers, while giving you the power to blast them out of space from the side. This allows for a very different, strategic approach when confronting enemies. Energy Shield The Energy Shield is a very powerful upgrade, making your rocket completely impervious to all dangers for a short time. Be careful of the timer though, it is quite inconvenient when you lose the shield in the middle of a battle. Destructo Beam Possibly the most effective offensive weapon in the universe, the Desructo Beam was actually a recovered Dreadnaught Annihilation Beam, which was re-engineered to fit on your rocket. Enjoy its destructive powers while they last! Artwork Rocket Blasters is the end result of a small series of ball-point pen drawings I did in October of 2017. The drawings were simple space themed images showing a small rocket ship, that developed into a story over the month long period. Someone suggested I animate the images, and I did one better and turned them into a game. An early drawing in the series",

         "According to the current astronomical observation and exploration, the solar system is composed of the sun, 9 planets and their satellites. For example: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto etc. This game is based on the background of various celestial bodies in the real solar system. It simulates that astronauts fly a spaceship from earth orbit to the moon first. After reach to the Moon select the planets or satellites they want to explore, and then start the whole solar system exploration tour. Due to the long distance of the spacecraft to the target planet, the fuel carried by the spacecraft cannot reach directly. Scientists first created a route to the target planet and set up a number of space refueling stations along the route. During the voyage to the target planet, the spacecraft can dock at the space refueling station to replenish fuel so as to continue the voyage and complete the exploration journey. If the spacecraft runs out of fuel or is hit by a meteorite during exploration, The spacecraft will crash, and the entire mission has failed. Tip: this game needs a certain amount of astronomical knowledge to better complete the task of exploring the entire solar system.",

         "STATIC 2.0 UPDATE: Releases February 14th! Enjoy a fully revamped and remastered Static experience! New assets, new lighting, and new gameplay mechanics! This new update to Static adds a creeper and more immersive experience including more detailed graphical assets, redesigns for characters and UI, an expanded story featuring new voice talent for the protagonist and all-new secret achievements to unlock! This update is free to anyone who already owns Static and will replace the original game when the update releases on February 14th! You built this tower from the ground up, everything inside, from the AI to the building layout is by your design. You worked hard to ensure that you had the premiere residence in the city of Umbriol, but now, why is everyone gone? You wake up in your penthouse, greeted by your concerned AI. She serves as not only your personal assistant, but also as the building manager. You soon realize that she is the only company you have left in the entire building. She claims that she knows how to get you out, but something seems off. Getting out is important, but what about all your residents? Can you figure out why your once prosperous tower is now filled with nothing but static? Static is part psychological thriller, part escape the room, part investigation adventure. The game is set entirely in first person, giving you the ability to fully explore all of your surroundings. You will have ten floors to get through, each unique to the people living there. You will work to discover what they were working on, what led to the events that you find yourself in, and what exactly happened to everyone that used to live there. Static is designed to take roughly 2-4 hours to complete, with two possible endings. The alternative ending however, will not be obvious as to how to reach it. We have worked to create a 3D game to show off everything that everyone at Dogwood Gaming has learned and built upon, we are incredibly thrilled to share what we built with you! Features - - A full 10 story futuristic tower to explore - Carefully crafted horror elements to keep you uneasy for the entire experience - Our first fully voice acted game - Full freedom of exploration, with all objects hand placed with purpose throughout all the rooms - Hundreds of unique assets to give our game a unique feel - Fully integrated with the Ashes of Kanaka universe, expanding on the story and universe we have already created We would also like to note that shortly after the release of Static, we will be releasing a FREE update to Ashes of Kanaka that will include the main character from Static as a follower, fully integrated with the story just as you would expect from all the other companions.",

         "UfoPilot : Astro-Creeps Elite puts you at the controls of a nimble Vector-class starfighter in an epic mission to rid the galaxy of the pesky Astro-Creeps. This game is a revival of the classic Asteroids-style gameplay, with a twist. You control a small ship that must destroy entire fields of asteroids, but inside these space rocks live the evil Astro-Creeps. While the asteroids will drift blindly thru space, the Astro-Creeps, once released, will chase you down. Controls We have worked hard to create intuitive and responsive controls for this game. You aim with the mouse and fire with the left mouse button. You can thrust with your main engines using the right mouse button, and you will accelerate in the direction you are aiming. For finer control, you can also use the WASD keys to maneuver your ship in axial directions. Combine WASD and the right mouse button for even higher rates of thrust and supreme control. It is also possible to use an XBOX 360 Controller to play the game. Your Arsenal and Powerups You always have access to unlimited ammunition (orange) that you can use to destroy asteroids and Astro-Creeps. There are also 7 powerups that can be dropped randomly by asteroids and Astro-Creeps: Bombs - When detonated Bombs fire a ring of projectiles around your ship. Bounce Bullets - Unlike normal bullets (orange) Bounce bullets (blue) will continue bouncing off the edges of the screen until they hit something. Lasers - Lasers travel at infinite speed, unlike bullets, and immediately destroy everything in their path. Shields - Shields grant you invulnerability for 10 seconds, allowing you to plow thru hordes of asteroids and Astro-Creeps. Anti-Gravity - Anti-Gravity pushes things away from you for 10 seconds, allowing you to keep a safe distance between your ship and the enemy. Decoys - When a Decoy is on the playing field, all Astro-Creeps will chase it instead of your ship. Deflectors - A Deflector creates a bubble in space, within which you can remain and fire out from. Nothing else can penetrate the Deflector. All of the Powerups can be combined to great effect, with some specific twists: Bombs can fire Bounce and Laser ammunition in a devastating ring. This can be toggled in Gameplay Options. When you have both Shield and Anti-Gravity, your ship will transform into a Black Hole. With a Black Hole active, your ship is both completely invulnerable and will suck all enemies into itself, destroying them. While the default is for the game to automatically select Lasers and Bounce bullets when you have them, it is possible to enable manual weapon selection in Gameplay Options. Gameplay Options There are many Gameplay Options to choose from, resulting in 1024 permutations. How to play is up to you, and you can name and store your custom settings locally for easy access: Auto-Brake - Enabled by default, this will slow your ship to a halt when not accelerating. Explosion Impulses - Disabled by default, this will cause explosions to knock things around to a greater extent. Auto-select Weapon - Enabled by default, this will cause the game automatically select your must powerful ammunition for you (Laser, Bounce, Normal). Bombs use Lasers - Enabled by default, this causes Bombs to use Laser ammunition. Bombs use Bounces - Enabled by default, this causes Bombs to use Bounce ammunition. Weapon Recoil - Enabled by default, this causes weapons discharge to push your ship in the opposite direction. Explosive Asteroids - Enabled by default, this causes medium sized Explosive Asteroids to sometimes spawn. Destroying these will cause an explosion equivalent to a Bomb detonation with normal bullets. Explosive Bounce Asteroids - Enabled by default, this causes medium sized Explosive Bounce Asteroids to sometimes spawn. Destroying these will cause an explosion equivalent to a Bomb detonation with Bounce bullets. Random Powerups - Enabled by default, this will cause Powerups to spawn in random order. When disabled, Powerups will spawn sequentially by type. Shootable Powerups - Disabled by default, this will allow the player to pickup Powerups by shooting them with bullets or Lasers. Soundtrack The game features 7 custom composed tracks of electro/drone music by Johannes 'johno' Norneby. Steam Leaderboards Specific to the Steam release, the game now stores high scores in the Steam Leaderboards. It is thereby possible to prove that you are indeed the best UfoPilot : Astro-Creeps Elite player in the known universe.",

         "Time Warpers is what's called an 'incremental game'. There's always a fun upgrade to look forward to, and the numbers keep getting bigger! Collect gold, upgrade your weapons &amp; teammates, and even join up with other players in the world as you defeat the enemies &amp; get stronger. All of your favorite things from Time Clickers: Time Cubes, Weapon Cubes, Active Abilities, Maximum Damage &amp; Research (aka Artifacts) are back and better than ever. UPDATE 6 - TIMELINE CARDS Promoting a teammate into Training (500, 1500, etc) gives you the ability to choose a card. When choosing a card you can select from 3 options, each card has their own bonus. There are 13 card types - each type has 4 cards (like a deck of cards). The more you collect of each card, the bigger the bonus. UPDATE 10 - OVERPOWERED! Overpowered kicks in as soon as you are e7 times stronger than a Zone, but you'll need to be e17 times stronger to be 100% Overpowered. The more Overpowered you are the more damage you'll do, instantly destroying a wave of enemies when you're 100% Overpowered. You'll also move faster, doubling your movement &amp; Hover Bike speed when you're 100% Overpowered. UPDATE 17 - AIR STRIKE Call in an Air Strike to do massive damage. Each Air Strike instantly deals 25%-100% damage to a Wave depending on how you've invested your Weapon Cubes. The Air Strike is perfect for when you're pushing through a deep run and need an extra burst of damage. UPDATE 23 - STEAM TRADING CARDS IDLE &amp; AUTOMATION Hop into your Hoverbike and automatically drive through the world as your Automatic Fire ability shoots auto-targeted enemies, letting you progress through the world even when you're away from your computer. The more you play the more you can automate. ACTIVE PLAY Take the controls and progress through the world faster. Find the optimal spots to quickly defeat enemies and swiftly move through the world using jump dash and bunnyhop. ENDLESS PROGRESSION Upgrade Perks from Common to Legendary. Invest Time Cubes into Research making you stronger with each run as you explore thousands of zones spread across multiple unique planets. How far can you get? MULTIPLAYER, CO-OP or SINGLE PLAYER Play in a Private, Co-Op (friends can join) or Public World. In Co-Op &amp; Public Worlds, player's Hoverbikes can merge together creating convoy snakes that move through the world as a pack. Get stronger and become the carrier of a group, or be backup support as you idle. You have the choice; go further together or faster alone. GUN CUSTOMIZATION Collect Perks and customize your Click Weapons, Drone &amp; Turret.

         "Dimension Drifter is a fast paced, ultra-violent action shooter. Our timeline has collapsed and many didn't even notice. Since then, inexplicable mysteries started happening all over the world. Strange sightings of objects and beings. Crop circles appeared. Cattle mutilation. Memories that didn't reflect reality anymore. The list gets longer every day... All of this was just the beginning. Since then, hundreds of years have passed. It all spiraled out of control. One day, strange portals to another dimension have opened and Demons poured out. An endless war began. Some cities have created plasma domes around them, protecting them from the eternal onslaught. But most now lie in ruins. Some extraordinary people who were able to survive long enough in the ruins have harnessed special abilities. In the eye of the public, these powers are deemed evil and it is said they are of demonic nature. These special people are outcasts, not allowed to enter the Domes of safety anymore. They are called Drifters. Features Super fluid action gameplay. Tight controls compared with animation cancelling actions make you feel in absolute control 100% of the time. Brutal Action combined with a deep Pen&amp;Paper RPG world. The World of Dimension Drifter has been created over a period of 15 years as a Pen&amp;Paper RPG foundation. Reveal more and more about the world as you progress through the missions. Endless levels that are randomly arranged each time you play. But robots can't design intuitive maps. As a modern mapper for the original Doom, I've added certain intelligence to the level creation to make it feel as humanly crafted as possible. Each room piece is also designed by hand to give everything you see a manmade feel. Thousands of randomized progression items. Like in Diablo and other loot-oriented games, the game offers almost endless combinations of items you can find to improve your Drifter. Visual character customization is also a great aspect of the game design. Choose between Male or Female Drifter and have a lot of outfits to mix and match, with tons of colors to choose for each piece. I want the Drifter to be YOUR OWN! However, during the very early Early Access time, this content may be limited to only a few options.",

         "Star Realms has gone insane! Introducing Cthulhu Realms! Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

         "Sometimes there is nothing better than a tourney in a classic battleships game. You can see a beautifully designed sea battle, familiar to those from your school times. You have to play against the computer and you need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed. Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.",

         "Steam Squad - tactical wargame, where gameplay takes place at the alternative universe with steampunk details during the times of the Great War amongst colorful anime like settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself. Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting. Your support and feedback is vital for us as they help us to improve and make game even better.",

         "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",

         "“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",

         "It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before. And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!",

         "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

         "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes",

         "Star Realms has gone insane! Introducing Cthulhu Realms! Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

You have to play against the computer and you need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed. Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.",

         "Steam Squad - tactical wargame, where gameplay takes place at the alternative universe with steampunk details during the times of the Great War amongst colorful anime like settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself. Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting. Your support and feedback is vital for us as they help us to improve and make game even better.",

         "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",

         "“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",

         "It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before. And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!",

         "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

         "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes",

         "Reigns: Game of Thrones is the heir to the award-winning HBO® TV series Game of Thrones® and the smash-hit swipe ‘em up series Reigns from Nerial and Devolver Digital. Through the fiery visions of Melisandre, claim the Iron Throne as Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and more to carefully navigate the complex relationships and hostile factions of the Seven Kingdoms. Employ ruthless tactics to outwit political rivals and wield impervious charm on your fickle bannerman. Maintain the balance and favor of the people to extend your reign and maybe, one day, survive the horrors of the coming winter. A Formidable Cast: Rule from the Iron Throne as Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, Sansa Stark, and more. Change between each king and queen you unlock to face challenges and mysteries unique to their story. Impose Your Will: Swipe left or right to change the fate of the Seven Kingdoms forever as you hear the impassioned pleas and unpredictable demands from the people of Westeros. If a particular character becomes bothersome, tear their card in half to unburden Your Majesty with their concerns – but at what cost? Reenvision Westeros: Melisandre’s visions are your playing field and extend beyond the TV series to imagine the many fates of those that would sit upon the Iron Throne. Rebuild the Great Sept of Baelor as Cersei or discover the path of the Seven Kingdoms if Sansa Stark had married Jaime Lannister. Regal Mini Games: Even the most powerful rulers need to set aside their worries and partake in more trivial matters now and then. From jousting to tavern brawls, these distractions aren’t without consequence! A Grander Reigns: Fans of the Reigns series will be delighted with the biggest, deepest entry in the series that does not simply retell the stories you know but rather lets you create new adventures at your whim. Iconic Soundtrack: Decide the fate of Westeros and those that reside in your land to the soaring score of the HBO series by Ramin Djawadi. ©2018 Home Box Office, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
