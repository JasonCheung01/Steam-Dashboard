         "Star Realms has gone insane! Introducing Cthulhu Realms! Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

         "Sometimes there is nothing better than a tourney in a classic battleships game. You can see a beautifully designed sea battle, familiar to those from your school times. You have to play against the computer and you need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed. Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.",

         "Steam Squad - tactical wargame, where gameplay takes place at the alternative universe with steampunk details during the times of the Great War amongst colorful anime like settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself. Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting. Your support and feedback is vital for us as they help us to improve and make game even better.",

         "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",

         "“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",

         "It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before. And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!",

         "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

         "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes",

         "Thrillville™: Off the Rails lives up to its name with 20 death-defying rides so outrageous, they inspire the same word from every park visitor who sees them: “WHOA!” Players build these incredible “WHOA Coasters” to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning ring of fire and more. But the new fun doesn’t stop there. Off the Rails features 34 playable multiplayer minigames, 15 all-new theme areas, over 40 thrill rides, a new story that ties together more than 100 missions, and social interaction with park guests that’s better than ever. The in-depth conversations both advance the plot and suggest better ways to manage the park. But is every guest to be trusted? Experience the visceral fun of interacting with a theme park you create. Build and ride your own creations, talk and joke with all your guests, and play dozens of minigames. Visit 15 themed areas, like Battleville, Winterville, Spaceville and Aeroville, all spread throughout five new parks. Create 20 death-defying WHOA Coasters such as: Hotrod Stunt - A nitro boost propels a car across a broken track. Pendulizer - A giant arm grabs the car just before a gap in the track, whips it around in a full circle, then sets it down on the other side. Escape Drop - The track holds the car stationary as it lifts itself from level ground to a full 90-degree drop. Then it lets go. Distinguish your rides even more with enhanced customization options. Attach animatronics, flowers and flaming hoops to all of your coasters and rides. Play 34 minigames – 14 new, 20 returning from the original Thrillville but with new levels.",

She exchanges her busy career at a software company to fill in for her dad, the local mail carrier. During her two-week stay in beautiful Providence Oaks, Oregon, she runs into a few familiar faces as well as plenty of new folk. As Meredith, you get to decide who to talk to, who to befriend and perhaps even start a romantic relationship with. Whatever happens, at the end of her stint she'll have to make up her mind: return to her demanding job in the big city, or stay in the town she grew up in? Play Lake and… Escape to a beautiful, rustic environment without cellphones and the Internet. Drive around the lake in your dad's trusty mail truck, or let the auto-pilot do the work. Talk to a range of engaging characters, each with their own personalities and quirks. Choose after-work activities: hang out with your friends, help out your neighbours or stay home and read a book. Experience two weeks of branching story that doesn't shy away from slice-of-life themes. Determine your own story: there are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers or endings, simply what you want to happen.",

Specials are powerups that can be activated in-game. They vary in duration and function and have a certain power level. The specials are described in the select menu before starting the game. While in-game you have four specials per run, of which three can be chosen from the select menu whereas the last one (the most powerful one) is locked. A particular type of specials are 'Allies'.

         "Rocket Blasters is a fast paced, action packed space themed shoot-em-up. Rack up points by destroying asteroids and enemies on your trip through the stars. Gameplay There is nothing too deep going on here, blow up asteroids, enemy spaceships and occasional bosses in your very own super awesome rocket ship. Get a variety of upgraded weapons in order to help blow up more asteroids, enemy spaceships ... you get the idea. Find out if you have the right stuff to get on (and stay on) the Rocket Blasters Steam Leaderboards! Unique Scoring System Rocket Blasters has a unique system that rewards precision and restraint while blowing stuff up. Each time you fire your weapon, you lose a point, that's right, you lose a point for shooting. However, each time you hit something, you will get 2 or more points back, depending on what you hit. Spamming bullets may be easier, but it will not get you the high score. Check your score on the Steam Global Leader Boards! The Dread Pizza Armada in all its glory Enemies Asteroids are not the only obstacle your rocket will encounter along the way. The Dread Pizza Armada is planning an attack on Earth, and you must destroy as many of their drones as possible. Drones You will encounter many of these dangerous robot ships on your journey. Avoid them, and their lasers, or suffer a painful demise. Shooting them will earn you more points than blasting asteroids, so thinking strategically about what you shoot will help you raise your score. Pizza Armada Battleships The Dread Pizza Armada was named after these oddly shaped triangular battleships. Be careful of lingering behind them, as they have a dangerous array of lasers aimed right at you! Colossal Dreadnoughts The Colossal Dreadnought is the rarest and most dangerous ship in the Armada. Huge and heavily armored, your rocket will have to be quick to avoid its dreaded Annihilation Beam, which destroys everything in its path, including asteroids, your rocket and even its own drones. Finding its weak spot will be key in overcoming this deadly foe. Battling a Pizza Armada Dreadnought Upgrades Your rocket starts with a simple laser blaster, however, as you progress through the game, you may find some useful, temporary upgrades along the way. Look for the floating upgrade gear, and simply fly into it in order to upgrade your rocket. Upgrades have a time limit, indicated by the numbers that appear above your rocket on the screen. Triple Blasters Two extra lasers allow you to clear a path through obstacles and enemies much more efficiently than the single cannon you start with. Side Cannons Side Cannons allow you to slip past enemies and dangers, while giving you the power to blast them out of space from the side. This allows for a very different, strategic approach when confronting enemies. Energy Shield The Energy Shield is a very powerful upgrade, making your rocket completely impervious to all dangers for a short time. Be careful of the timer though, it is quite inconvenient when you lose the shield in the middle of a battle. Destructo Beam Possibly the most effective offensive weapon in the universe, the Desructo Beam was actually a recovered Dreadnaught Annihilation Beam, which was re-engineered to fit on your rocket. Enjoy its destructive powers while they last! Artwork Rocket Blasters is the end result of a small series of ball-point pen drawings I did in October of 2017. The drawings were simple space themed images showing a small rocket ship, that developed into a story over the month long period. Someone suggested I animate the images, and I did one better and turned them into a game. An early drawing in the series",

         "According to the current astronomical observation and exploration, the solar system is composed of the sun, 9 planets and their satellites. For example: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto etc. This game is based on the background of various celestial bodies in the real solar system. It simulates that astronauts fly a spaceship from earth orbit to the moon first. After reach to the Moon select the planets or satellites they want to explore, and then start the whole solar system exploration tour. Due to the long distance of the spacecraft to the target planet, the fuel carried by the spacecraft cannot reach directly. Scientists first created a route to the target planet and set up a number of space refueling stations along the route. During the voyage to the target planet, the spacecraft can dock at the space refueling station to replenish fuel so as to continue the voyage and complete the exploration journey. If the spacecraft runs out of fuel or is hit by a meteorite during exploration, The spacecraft will crash, and the entire mission has failed. Tip: this game needs a certain amount of astronomical knowledge to better complete the task of exploring the entire solar system.",

         "STATIC 2.0 UPDATE: Releases February 14th! Enjoy a fully revamped and remastered Static experience! New assets, new lighting, and new gameplay mechanics! This new update to Static adds a creeper and more immersive experience including more detailed graphical assets, redesigns for characters and UI, an expanded story featuring new voice talent for the protagonist and all-new secret achievements to unlock! This update is free to anyone who already owns Static and will replace the original game when the update releases on February 14th! You built this tower from the ground up, everything inside, from the AI to the building layout is by your design. You worked hard to ensure that you had the premiere residence in the city of Umbriol, but now, why is everyone gone? You wake up in your penthouse, greeted by your concerned AI. She serves as not only your personal assistant, but also as the building manager. You soon realize that she is the only company you have left in the entire building. She claims that she knows how to get you out, but something seems off. Getting out is important, but what about all your residents? Can you figure out why your once prosperous tower is now filled with nothing but static? Static is part psychological thriller, part escape the room, part investigation adventure. The game is set entirely in first person, giving you the ability to fully explore all of your surroundings. You will have ten floors to get through, each unique to the people living there. You will work to discover what they were working on, what led to the events that you find yourself in, and what exactly happened to everyone that used to live there. Static is designed to take roughly 2-4 hours to complete, with two possible endings. The alternative ending however, will not be obvious as to how to reach it. We have worked to create a 3D game to show off everything that everyone at Dogwood Gaming has learned and built upon, we are incredibly thrilled to share what we built with you! Features - - A full 10 story futuristic tower to explore - Carefully crafted horror elements to keep you uneasy for the entire experience - Our first fully voice acted game - Full freedom of exploration, with all objects hand placed with purpose throughout all the rooms - Hundreds of unique assets to give our game a unique feel - Fully integrated with the Ashes of Kanaka universe, expanding on the story and universe we have already created We would also like to note that shortly after the release of Static, we will be releasing a FREE update to Ashes of Kanaka that will include the main character from Static as a follower, fully integrated with the story just as you would expect from all the other companions.",

Nova Flow is a first person, speed running platformer built upon finding a balance in the rhythmic mechanics of the game. Making it from start to finish in the best time possible is your aim; your weapon of manipulation, your instinctive reflexes and a dash of ingenuity are key to obtaining top spot. Nova Flow’s simple movement system is coupled with more complex interactions as you progress. These interactions marry together to give the player a rapid and smooth-flowing experience as you traverse a large variety of levels designed to measure your skills and put you to the test as you attempt to best the rest. As you jump, run, and shoot your Nova Cannon you'll find additional ways to interact with your surroundings and the challenges that confront you. Laser obstacles, strange switch targets and gates to pass through will put you in a spin as you try to find the fastest way through the game's levels. Speed, Bounce, and Wall-run your way through the world. As you go, you'll encounter more obstacles and mechanics. Get creative with your runs, as you tackle the Standard, Random, and Custom modes. Repeat your runs for the best time. It wouldn't be a speedrunner without leaderboards! Track your best against ours to acheive a medal; Bronze, Silver, Gold, and our coveted Dev times. Compare your times against others too in our online leaderboards! An intense score accompanies the gameplay. The up-tempo music sets the rhythm as you run and jump through the game.

         "UfoPilot : Astro-Creeps Elite puts you at the controls of a nimble Vector-class starfighter in an epic mission to rid the galaxy of the pesky Astro-Creeps. This game is a revival of the classic Asteroids-style gameplay, with a twist. You control a small ship that must destroy entire fields of asteroids, but inside these space rocks live the evil Astro-Creeps. While the asteroids will drift blindly thru space, the Astro-Creeps, once released, will chase you down. Controls We have worked hard to create intuitive and responsive controls for this game. You aim with the mouse and fire with the left mouse button. You can thrust with your main engines using the right mouse button, and you will accelerate in the direction you are aiming. For finer control, you can also use the WASD keys to maneuver your ship in axial directions. Combine WASD and the right mouse button for even higher rates of thrust and supreme control. It is also possible to use an XBOX 360 Controller to play the game. Your Arsenal and Powerups You always have access to unlimited ammunition (orange) that you can use to destroy asteroids and Astro-Creeps. There are also 7 powerups that can be dropped randomly by asteroids and Astro-Creeps: Bombs - When detonated Bombs fire a ring of projectiles around your ship. Bounce Bullets - Unlike normal bullets (orange) Bounce bullets (blue) will continue bouncing off the edges of the screen until they hit something. Lasers - Lasers travel at infinite speed, unlike bullets, and immediately destroy everything in their path. Shields - Shields grant you invulnerability for 10 seconds, allowing you to plow thru hordes of asteroids and Astro-Creeps. Anti-Gravity - Anti-Gravity pushes things away from you for 10 seconds, allowing you to keep a safe distance between your ship and the enemy. Decoys - When a Decoy is on the playing field, all Astro-Creeps will chase it instead of your ship. Deflectors - A Deflector creates a bubble in space, within which you can remain and fire out from. Nothing else can penetrate the Deflector. All of the Powerups can be combined to great effect, with some specific twists: Bombs can fire Bounce and Laser ammunition in a devastating ring. This can be toggled in Gameplay Options. When you have both Shield and Anti-Gravity, your ship will transform into a Black Hole. With a Black Hole active, your ship is both completely invulnerable and will suck all enemies into itself, destroying them. While the default is for the game to automatically select Lasers and Bounce bullets when you have them, it is possible to enable manual weapon selection in Gameplay Options. Gameplay Options There are many Gameplay Options to choose from, resulting in 1024 permutations. How to play is up to you, and you can name and store your custom settings locally for easy access: Auto-Brake - Enabled by default, this will slow your ship to a halt when not accelerating. Explosion Impulses - Disabled by default, this will cause explosions to knock things around to a greater extent. Auto-select Weapon - Enabled by default, this will cause the game automatically select your must powerful ammunition for you (Laser, Bounce, Normal). Bombs use Lasers - Enabled by default, this causes Bombs to use Laser ammunition. Bombs use Bounces - Enabled by default, this causes Bombs to use Bounce ammunition. Weapon Recoil - Enabled by default, this causes weapons discharge to push your ship in the opposite direction. Explosive Asteroids - Enabled by default, this causes medium sized Explosive Asteroids to sometimes spawn. Destroying these will cause an explosion equivalent to a Bomb detonation with normal bullets. Explosive Bounce Asteroids - Enabled by default, this causes medium sized Explosive Bounce Asteroids to sometimes spawn. Destroying these will cause an explosion equivalent to a Bomb detonation with Bounce bullets. Random Powerups - Enabled by default, this will cause Powerups to spawn in random order. When disabled, Powerups will spawn sequentially by type. Shootable Powerups - Disabled by default, this will allow the player to pickup Powerups by shooting them with bullets or Lasers. Soundtrack The game features 7 custom composed tracks of electro/drone music by Johannes 'johno' Norneby. Steam Leaderboards Specific to the Steam release, the game now stores high scores in the Steam Leaderboards. It is thereby possible to prove that you are indeed the best UfoPilot : Astro-Creeps Elite player in the known universe.",

THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME! This means that it's not the full game, in fact the version that is currently uploaded is about 80% of what was available to play at Rezzed and on my Website. A large section of it has been re-designed. You can play using WSAD or cursor keys to move around or even a JoyPad.

You remotely control a quad copter exploring an abandoned scientific facility, only able to see via its lidar scanning the surroundings. It’s atmospheric to the max–sounds echoing in empty corridors, clinical beeping coming from the automated defenses of the facility.', 'Taking gaming back to simple game play Containment Protocol mixes your imagination, memory and ability to play attention to successfully move forward', 'Bleak in every way: a story about an escaped nanovirus, an infrared scanner attached to your remote-controlled the only means of seeing and an aggressive military voice over berating your every mistake. Controlling the drone you seek out keycards and information to progress deeper into the facility and unravel what happened.']",

When choosing a card you can select from 3 options, each card has their own bonus. There are 13 card types - each type has 4 cards (like a deck of cards). The more you collect of each card, the bigger the bonus. UPDATE 10 - OVERPOWERED! Overpowered kicks in as soon as you are e7 times stronger than a Zone, but you'll need to be e17 times stronger to be 100% Overpowered. The more Overpowered you are the more damage you'll do, instantly destroying a wave of enemies when you're 100% Overpowered. You'll also move faster, doubling your movement &amp; Hover Bike speed when you're 100% Overpowered. UPDATE 17 - AIR STRIKE Call in an Air Strike to do massive damage. Each Air Strike instantly deals 25%-100% damage to a Wave depending on how you've invested your Weapon Cubes. The Air Strike is perfect for when you're pushing through a deep run and need an extra burst of damage. UPDATE 23 - STEAM TRADING CARDS IDLE &amp; AUTOMATION Hop into your Hoverbike and automatically drive through the world as your Automatic Fire ability shoots auto-targeted enemies, letting you progress through the world even when you're away from your computer. The more you play the more you can automate. ACTIVE PLAY Take the controls and progress through the world faster.

In Co-Op &amp; Public Worlds, player's Hoverbikes can merge together creating convoy snakes that move through the world as a pack.

         "Dimension Drifter is a fast paced, ultra-violent action shooter. Our timeline has collapsed and many didn't even notice. Since then, inexplicable mysteries started happening all over the world. Strange sightings of objects and beings. Crop circles appeared. Cattle mutilation. Memories that didn't reflect reality anymore. The list gets longer every day... All of this was just the beginning. Since then, hundreds of years have passed. It all spiraled out of control. One day, strange portals to another dimension have opened and Demons poured out. An endless war began. Some cities have created plasma domes around them, protecting them from the eternal onslaught. But most now lie in ruins. Some extraordinary people who were able to survive long enough in the ruins have harnessed special abilities. In the eye of the public, these powers are deemed evil and it is said they are of demonic nature. These special people are outcasts, not allowed to enter the Domes of safety anymore. They are called Drifters. Features Super fluid action gameplay. Tight controls compared with animation cancelling actions make you feel in absolute control 100% of the time. Brutal Action combined with a deep Pen&amp;Paper RPG world. The World of Dimension Drifter has been created over a period of 15 years as a Pen&amp;Paper RPG foundation. Reveal more and more about the world as you progress through the missions. Endless levels that are randomly arranged each time you play. But robots can't design intuitive maps. As a modern mapper for the original Doom, I've added certain intelligence to the level creation to make it feel as humanly crafted as possible. Each room piece is also designed by hand to give everything you see a manmade feel. Thousands of randomized progression items. Like in Diablo and other loot-oriented games, the game offers almost endless combinations of items you can find to improve your Drifter. Visual character customization is also a great aspect of the game design. Choose between Male or Female Drifter and have a lot of outfits to mix and match, with tons of colors to choose for each piece. I want the Drifter to be YOUR OWN! However, during the very early Early Access time, this content may be limited to only a few options.",

         "Star Realms has gone insane! Introducing Cthulhu Realms! Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.",

         "Steam Squad - tactical wargame, where gameplay takes place at the alternative universe with steampunk details during the times of the Great War amongst colorful anime like settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself. Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting. Your support and feedback is vital for us as they help us to improve and make game even better.",

         "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",

         "“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",

         "It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before. And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!",

         "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

         "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes",

         "Star Realms has gone insane! Introducing Cthulhu Realms! Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

You have to play against the computer and you need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed. Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.",

         "Steam Squad - tactical wargame, where gameplay takes place at the alternative universe with steampunk details during the times of the Great War amongst colorful anime like settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself. Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting. Your support and feedback is vital for us as they help us to improve and make game even better.",

         "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",

         "“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",

With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",

         "It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before. And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!",

         "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

         "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes",

Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another.

Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes\",\n",

Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND 异常 very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her.

Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people?

Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles.

       "  \"-It’s Your Responsibility to Change the World- Set on an Earth where mankind is being steadily annihilated by the alien invaders known as the BETA. Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that’s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player’s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they’ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player’s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factions’ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future we’ll be adding: ・More TSFs to fight in. ・Voice chat ・Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.\",\n",

       "  \"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system — your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.\",\n",

Along with her childhood friend Haru and a talking furball (rabbit?) god, she lives a peaceful life, but when an earthquake strikes, aggressive spirits suddenly appear and her world is torn apart. Sayaka receives divine tidings that the only one who can save the city is herself—she's actually an Onmyoji with the power to vanquish spirits! However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man... '...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!' Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight... 'There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?' With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals. With his help, Sayaka finally unlocks her battle-princess powers to wage war on the spirits that ravage her city... CHARACTER Heroine: Sayaka Mimuro Voice: Yui Sakakibara “Nothing is impossible if you give it your all.” A hardworking and beautiful girl with a strong sense of justice. Although Sayaka herself doesn't know it, she's descended from a line of Onmyoji sorcerers, and the powers of exorcism slumber within her. She was brought up to be responsible, and she'll never abandon anyone in need. She also tries to see the best in every situation—even the bad one that her dutiful nature has gotten her into now. When it comes to love, she has as much of an interest as anyone else, but the shrine work she does in her parents' stead has always kept her too busy to date. Weapon: Spirit Sword\",\n",

Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food.

       "  \"TowerClimb is a difficult and rewarding procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements. TowerClimb is set in a fantasy world where enormous and mysterious towers of ancient unknown origin stand above humanity, extending to the heavens. Humans are driven by curiosity to climb them, usually dying in the process. Struggle forward as a weak human, driven by an iron will to reach the top. The game borrows elements from the roguelike genre. A different adventure awaits each man; you will never play the same exact level twice. Run, Climb, Jump, Swim, and Fly your way up the tower's atmospheric and lethal worlds, using items and resources you find along your way. Quick thinking and strategy will keep you alive as you navigate the tower using unique platforming mechanics. TowerClimb is challenging, and rewards reflexes, skill, knowledge and problem solving ability. Quite often, The tower throws your character into dangerous situations which require you to think very carefully about your actions. A unique, randomly generated level system ensures players must always come up with interesting ways to complete a level. Hundreds of men will die before you posses enough skill and knowledge to conquer the tower. A screenshot of every man's death is saved, along with how he died, to track each and every attempt. TowerClimb at its core is an adventure platformer, with procedural levels and elements based on the rogue-like genre. It features local multiplayer support with an option for split-screen/single-screen. (a maximum of 25 simultaneous players is the limit. However, the game only supports 4 controllers (Xinput limitation). The remaining players must use the keyboard. A program like Xpadder can remap additional directinput controllers to keyboard keys) The game features a TON of content. The Tower is tall and daunting to conquer, with plenty of areas and secrets throughout the game. Getting/seeing everything will take players a long time. There's bonus modes to unlock and play on top of the main game as well. Each time you play the game, everything changes. The levels are different, random events can occur, rare items can be found, etc. The game will always keep you on your feet and give you refreshing challenges and experiences. The platforming mechanics in the game are set up to feel very tight and responsive in combination with the climbing mechanics. You always need to be on your feet and aware of your surroundings, while continually planning how to climb higher. As you progress higher, different worlds introduce new mechanics that mean your play style must evolve. 5 years in the making, by Davioware and Quazi, a team of two brothers who have been developing and playing games since childhood.\",\n",

Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each\\xa0containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a \\xa0thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards.

       "  \"Experience the thrill of one versus thousands in an all new open world setting with DYNASTY WARRIORS 9, the latest installment in the series! ・A New Open World Warriors Game For the first time in the series, the expansive land of China is shown on a single map with the introduction of an open world format for diverse progression through the game. The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.\",\n",

Whilst it would be advantageous to have played ' Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Regrets For The Future ', this episode can be enjoyed on its own. Not all characters are 18 or over. The Story Grendel Jinx : A lazy, megalomaniacal kleptomaniac Five years ago, she nearly suffered a fatal and self-inflicted accident during a school outing, saved only by the protagonist's fortuitous presence. After rescuing her, the protagonist is promptly coerced into signing a 'Friendship Agreement' form - a document designed to tie the protagonist to Grendel, both personally and financially, and then ultimately for the protagonist to join Grendel's organisation. With the arrival of the last day of term, Grendel needs to hand in her remaining homework or face the prospect of repeating a year. Drafting in the protagonist to solve her problem, Grendel is annoyed when her demands are swiftly rebuffed. Initiating a devious plan to ensure her education can progress without interruption, Grendel's actions soon attract her mother's attention, who has her own nefarious plans for the protagonist. Features By popular demand, CG graphics have now been introduced to enhance the gameplay. Funny and dramatic SHORT story. Gender selection, with gender-specific dialogue at various points in the game. Seven extra stories are available once the main story has been completed : ' Far Too Good For Us ' : Find out why the protagonist ended up in an upgraded broom cupboard (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Thine ' : A parcel arrives for the protagonist. Naturally, Grendel decides to open it (Part I) (accessed from the title screen). ' The Alien From Somewhere Out There ' : Grendel watches an age-inappropriate film (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Within ' : Emily is looking for something (part of the main story). ' Return to Castle Grendel ' : Grendel's classroom story continues (accessed from the title screen). ' We Want Information ' : ??? (part of the main story). ' High Jinx or Bye Jinx ' : The protagonist is a contestant in a gameshow (accessed from the title screen). Internal and Steam achievements (as per usual). Visual impairment settings, a background and CG gallery, and a music player. Both galleries are only available once the main story has been completed. Path and sound notification. Features the musical talents of Jessica Jenks. Genre : Comedy, drama, action. Romance : None (unless you count Grendels love of causing the protagonist problems). Recently signed Grendel's ' Friendship Document ' (more out of pity than anything else). Doesn't realise what exactly that entails. Whenever Grendel gets behind on homework, she takes the easy way out : Force someone to write everything up. With the protagonist now Grendel's 'Best Friend', what better way of starting this friendship than forcing the protagonist to deal with sixteen different assignments ? Miss Potts is Grendels teacher. She dislikes violence. The protagonists current boss. Soon to be the protagonists' secretary and general dogsbody. Absolutely nothing can go wrong there. Wanting nothing more than their daughter to take over the world, the best way of achieving this is through relentless indoctrination and... ultra-violent anime programs. Cody and the protagonist dislike each other intensely. Chole is a hard-working Phoenix Custodian operative The protagonists' mother. Well-meaning but overbearing. She would like the protagonist to settle down and start a family and is more than willing to help find possible partners. Believes the protagonist still works for a video game company but is ashamed to admit to it.\",\n",

His latest catch lies in his basement but she's not ready yet. Everything needs to be perfect for the ritual, when he'll show her 'True love'. The fan is a first person exploration game with a unique twist. Driven by a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, it will take you deep within the darkest places of Paris underground. Gameplay The Fan is entirely made with photos . It has a classic 'point and click' feel, using only left and right click but it's closer to the recent Telltale Game series than to traditional adventures games. There are no painful mini-games or artificially inserted sliding puzzles as it is more about discovery and choices. Find out more about the Killer and his victims as the story unfolds and you may be the one to ultimately decide their fate. WARNING : The game isn't rated yet but I wouldn't recommend if if you're under 16, due to the themes and some violent sequences. More About Me My name is Cyril and I'm a Frenchie indie game dev. The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough. So please, tell me what you think! Feel free to contact me directly if you have any question or comment, I'll be happy to answer!\",\n",

Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. So far, we've raised over £7000 for the charities CRISIS, The Clocktower Sanctuary and Shelter. Join us in the community section to discuss the game with the team! We're always listening and awaiting your feedback.\",\n",

Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura’s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you’ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together.

As such, Minds Eyes uses many elements that should not normally be combined in a proper horror game. None the less, through all of your feedback, videos and discussions, I was able to transform all of the successes and failures into my subsequent titles: A Girls Fabric Face and Suit 776. To that, I thank you all! :)) Minds Eyes brings you to a world of dreams. You wake up from your slumber to constantly discover you are still asleep. You venture throughout your own home as well as some pieces of your imagination to discover who or what is keeping you at sleep. Will you ever wake up? will you ever finish the journey? Venture through tense full moments of a chilling and nerve wrecking atmosphere that will keep you wondering 'When will something happen!'. Interact with the game and collect game objects which will overall affect your score in the end. Can you locate all game items?, can you make it without a single death? Check what the mind has in store. NOTE: This game is to be played with a single sitting. The estimated game time is 30-45min. This game also includes flashing lights. If flashing lights affect any of your medical conditions, please avoid the game. **SO! what is Minds Eyes really? think of it as an experiment. I have developed Minds Eyes to experiment with new mechanics, features, animations, interactions, and more. Ultimately, I am using this game to gather information in order to build my ultimate horror experience. Think of it as research and development!. I will be watching a large portion of videos that you all send out to me, and note what was good and bad. With that said, If possible, please give me a full on review of the game. Tell me what you likes, disliked and/or would change. This will ultimately let me know what to, and what not to include in future projects.\",\n",

The provincial armies, loyal to the aristocracy and the Four Great Houses, have claimed many of the nation’s great cities in the name of the Noble Alliance. The Imperial Army, called back from the four corners of the Empire, has only just begun its sweeping counterattack. After Rean managed to escape Trista with Celine and Valimar, he awakens in the mountains near his hometown uncertain what fate befell his friends, who bravely threw themselves in harm’s way to buy him time to flee. Though the road will not be an easy one, Rean decides to take up his sword again, journeying across Erebonia with his Divine Knight, Valimar, in search of his friends from Class VII and a way to end the conflict before its price becomes far too dear… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II in Japanese) is a direct sequel to Trails of Cold Steel, picking up one month after the decisive collision that changed the fate of the entire nation of Erebonia. The speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system returns with all the bells and whistles together with the new Overdrive mode, new means of transportation both across the land and sky, new allies, new dangers, and a renewed sense of hope as Rean tirelessly works to right the wrongs that have led the country to disarray. KEY FEATURES A Direct Sequel that Remembers the Past Clear data from Trails of Cold Steel carries over into Trails of Cold Steel II, granting players bonuses, and most importantly, remembering the many relationships cultivated during time spent at Thors Military Academy, allowing for more personalized conversations throughout the story. Take to the Land and Sky in New Modes of Transportation Fast travel isn’t just for Trista anymore; a personalized airship now allows players to swiftly choose and descend upon both familiar and foreign destinations alike—and on land, horseback riding not only returns, but players can now customize and utilize Angelica’s orbal bike for fast transportation across the map. The Link System Returns with a new Overdrive Mode Bonding with allies continues to pay off with the Combat Link System, netting a variety of combat benefits including healing, guarding, and more, and the new Overdrive mode allows linked characters to attack up to three turns in a row for new strategic battle options.

The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself. LEGACY About Amiga version (1993-1997) The enormous project of making an ideal game of our own started back in 1993. We soon became overly ambitious, and we had no idea of what it took to carry out our plans. But we couldn't give in, just took new challenges to make Damage the best it could be. In 1996 the game was ready and players loved it!\",\n",

Each area of Talumos was well thought-out, with each house, item, and object placed to tell the player something about the world or its inhabitants. The purpose is to create a world that feels lived-in and fully realized. YOU’RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE, ARE YOU Dive into the world of Talumos and learn about its rich and detailed history. Meet a variety of NPCs from the different races of the land: THE HETONIANS are intelligent and cunning. They build extravagant cities and castles, and war for land with themselves and the other races, for their greed knows no bounds. THE SKOGEN are a reclusive nature-dwelling people. They worship the Shapers, creators of Talumos, as well as the five true gods of the Moonlight Realm. Their devotion to the preservation of nature often leads to warring with the other races when their land is threatened. THE FORLORN are cursed dragon-like humanoids who live far away in the Skyreach Peaks. Historically shunned and scattered, the Forlorn are resentful of the other races and wait for their warleaders to lead them to glory in battle. THE FALLEN are what happens when the Black Flame, a power from another realm, is used to transform an entire nation. The result is a corrupting and undying sinister legion, led by a mad king, attempting to bring ruin to every living thing in Talumos. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS Fables of Talumos was brought to life with the proud support of 55 Backers on Kickstarter.\",\n",

What the game is about: Honey Rose: UFE tells the story of Red, a young university student with dreams of making it big at the masked fighting tournament . She looks up to Big Blue , the current champion, and aims to meet her idol in the ring ! However, she has a history of poor class attendance , and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. This year, she made a deal with her parents : she’d either graduate, or they’d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her one and only chance to make her dream come true! Thankfully, that’s where you come in ! With your guidance, she needs to balance her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation. The game is a life-management simulation , presented as a visual novel , with beat'em-up elements . In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning! Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!\",\n",

Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience. Xpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience. The game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events. Xpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees. Along with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving. The interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games. For the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods.\",\n",

       "  'Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation. The parameterization capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing or in 3D sketch module.

Deathmatch mode has no rounds and no arena destruction, it’s all about who can rack up more takedowns in 10 minutes! If you are feeling lucky, you can always go to random mode, where the wackiness is off limits! It matters not if you are a seasoned veteran of the gaming world or if you never touched a gamepad before: It just takes 4 buttons and 1 analog stick to have endless fun with your friends! Each arena breaks differently! Some arenas have special mechanics, like turning you into a dragon or sending in mysterious gifts. 10 Power Ups to spice up the combat even more! Everyone has a dash. Fight N’ Fall is best enjoyed with friends, so call your buds and invite them over for the fight and falling of a lifetime!

       "  \"A mystical world on the edge of destruction. Unlikely saviors joined by fate and duty. A mission driven by music, magic...and survival. Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul.\",\n",

Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck! In this game you’ll find: - good old platforms - lots of action and tactics - simple, exciting and original gameplay - 54 levels full of deadly traps - unique main character - 5 characters for walking through a game - perfect pixel art style.',\n",

A) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon’s gravity well. B) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he’s so smart.

D) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd’s screen with a torque wrench. Humanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero?

Beautiful and elegant 3D graphics offer panoramic views of 30 incredible levels in 5 amazing worlds. The game puts the player in the role of a marble, which is guided through a narrow winding course suspended in mid-air in five different worlds: Skyworld, Iceworld, Caveworld, Cloudworld and Lavaworld. The marble can be morphed into different balls with unique physical properties, like a Marble Ball, a Power Ball (which can be charged and have an accelerated 'dash', a 'jump' ability or switchable 'magnetism' properties), a Steel Ball (which can push heavy objects around), and so forth. Each course contains obstacles and traps, such as wooden blocks, sheets of cloth, spinning fans, magnets, and cannons. The game uses physics-based puzzles as well, such as moving boxes; also, different balls react to the environment in different ways; Steel Balls, for example, will tear cloth platforms. Each level is timed, and players are rewarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals, depending on how quickly they complete the level. Switchball has received several awards over the years and is now relaunched on Steam as Switchball HD. Originally called Crazy Ball, the game won 'Best PC Game' during the 2005 Swedish Game Awards and was a finalist in the 'Technical Excellence Class' during the 2006 Independent Games Festival. Switchball also won Team Xbox XBLA Game of the Year in 2007. This type of game never goes out of date!\",\n",

       "  \"Thousands of writings and books tell of encounters with witches, ghosts, demons and the devil himself. Our world is complex and unexplored. We mostly don't notice anything of all this thanks to secret organizations whose objective is the elimination of paranormal phenomena . In Beyond Senses, you'll slip into the role of either a good hunter or an evil demon. Discover the world Beyond our Senses! Countless features guarantee a varied and unforgettable gaming experience . Beyond Senses can be played by up to 5 players! Beyond Senses is one of those rare multiplayer horror games that offer more than just one game mode! Three game modes are currently available: HUNT , EGOIST and BANISHMENT . Each game mode can be customized to your personal needs. In HUNT , your task is to weaken the wandering creature by charging blessed Energy Crystals and killing it afterwards. The more energy the Crystals receive, the weaker the creature becomes after some time. If the creature is weakened enough, you can kill it with your weapons and send it back to hell! In EGOIST you compete against your fellow players. Your goal is to conquer as many Energy Crystals as possible. Whoever has conquered the fewest Energy Crystals after a certain time will be hunted mercilessly by the wandering creature. You can use a stun gun to put your fellow players out of action for a short time and gain a time advantage. In BANISHMENT you must find all the cursed items and place them properly in a pentagram . Once you have successfully completed the ritual, you must lure the wandering creature into the pentagram to send it back to hell! Evil is all around us. Each location is individually designed and can be played in any game mode . All players should have the opportunity to create the best possible gaming experience for themselves. For this reason, new locations are constantly being added . There are currently 3 different maps available: CEMETERY FOREST HORROR HOUSE If you play as a hunter, you can currently choose between 4 different characters: John Hughes , Lauren Williams , Elijah Knight and Amy King ! As a creature, you currently have the choice between Dr. Walker (ghost) and Valac (demon). Both hunters and monsters have different 'skins', which can change the appearance of the characters. These skins will be unlocked during the course of the game by gaining experience points . From time to time there will be bonus actions or contests in which special skins can be unlocked. More hunters, monsters and skins will be added during the development of the game! So that your gaming experience does not go unrewarded, there is a level system. You start with level 1 and can work your way up to level 30. As you reach new levels, you'll unlock more skins , skills , lamps , weapons , tools and titles . Your experience points are assigned to your account and are not tied to your characters. The higher your current level is, the harder it will be to reach the next level. There is also a suitable subsystem : All tools and skills themselves can reach a higher level and become better through frequent use. Your account data is comfortably and securely stored in the Steam Cloud, so you can access it from other computers at any time! Beyond Senses offers a lot of features that we can't list completely with individual headings here. Therefore, all features of Beyond Senses that haven't been mentioned before are listed in this section: You can carry 2 of currently 4 gadgets with you: Holy Water, Sound Emitter, Incense Bomb, Devil's Trap Currently you can select 1 out of 6 possible light sources: Glowstick, Phone, Hand Lamp, Flashlight, Portable Searchlight, Night Vision At the moment you have 3 different handguns at your disposal: Remorse, Peacemaker, Vanquisher As a Hunter you can use one skill per round: Invisibility, Energy Incantation, Resurrection, Banishment, Teleportation Each Monster has 2 - 3 different skills, which can be used several times per round Currently you can unlock 5 titles: Ghost Hunter, Monster Banisher, Scaredy-Cat, Doll Hater, Living Legend .

Many creatures have gained sentience in this timeline leading to the rise of frogman, catsons, owlpeople and many other races. Over time humans have developed psychic abilities that they can invoke with the use of mechanical psychic actuators, these psychic abilities allow them to summon fire or teleport to new locations among many other powers. The destruction of this world was caused by Dark Gods of sacrifice known as the Gods of Destruction, the player can sacrifice items to these entities in order to receive powerful boons from them. The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse. Design Goals Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account. We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game. We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items. Controls Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile. Right click to bring out a drop-down menu of all possible actions for a given tile. Tab to show or hide the sidebar. FAQ Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format. We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information. How do you guys make money? We sell bonds which grant membership. The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire. This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member. What is membership? Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world. Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out! Will you ever sell experience or items directly? No we will not. The only thing we will sell are bonds. The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them. The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game. We don't believe in selling power. What are your goals in terms of membership? Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time. Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing! What happens when I die in game? All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will re-spawn in Split City. Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them? No we will not, dying in game and losing items is part of the game and it's up to you to bank important items you don't wish to lose. How many towns are there in game? There are 14 towns currently in the game. What happens if I forget my password? As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you. At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms. Why aren't you guys doing Early Access? The way we view MMORPG's is that they are inherently a service. Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live. Due to this we didn't want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline. How often will you update the game? We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content, however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on. We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update. Will you ever expand the world map? Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game. However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game. Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends? No you won't. All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them, this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that it's your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways (like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level). Will I get banned for using/creating a third party client? We won't be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense. The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version. Will I get banned for macroing or botting? Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense. We suggest avoiding macroing entirely.\",\n",

Originally released in a non-Steam version around April of 2013. Please note that our second game, Boo Bunny Plague, already received the Greenlight in mid-2014 and has been on Steam. We are currently hard at work on our third game. STORY: It all started in Nordic Cove, a small hamlet in the fictional state we all know today as “New York”. Once called New Hamburgerstand in the early A.D. years, it flourished with fur trades and Bacon Cheeseburgers. It was also home to the gravesite of a crusty, sorcerous, evil-naughty-person; the Viking warlord “Helfdane the Terrible!” Helfdane’s tyranny of the New Land was halted during these very rough times due to bad planning, and terrible hygiene. Today, Bacon Cheeseburgers are still at an all-time high, and New North America is on the verge of being historically ♥♥♥♥♥-slapped. An archaeologist cork-sniffer named Dr. Howard Bre, and his lovely assistant, Kayte Sparo have disturbed this ancient gravesite. Thus, fulfilling a curse which reanimated Helfdane and his minions to rip the life force from beings starting with Nordic Cove! Holy crap! Kayte’s boyfriend, Paulie Chops, must find the help he needs to turn this around, stat! This is their date night after all. Don’t act like you’ve not had a night like this. Alright! YOU deal with that Helfdane thing. We’re getting Bacon Cheeseburgers and staying warm. We’ll be cheering for you! GAMEPLAY: The Curse of the Nordic Cove is a game, by gamers, for gamers. There are familiar elements of gameplay for all gaming fans from First Person Shooter, Sports, Puzzle-Solving, to Driving, Strategic Shooting and Stealth and Dungeon Crawling. This and more thrown at you, the player, in an eccentric and thrilling Survival-Horror game like no other. Using your choice of controls being Keyboard/Mouse combo or Gamepad, you maneuver the various characters through each level to complete a task and survive. All along the way, each character you control encounters enemies of various forms that will not hesitate to attack. There are obstacles that you need to figure out how to overcome.

You’re told you are an astronaut inside some kind of alien structure hurtling towards Earth, but it’s also about something deeper than that.” Under the surface, there is a subtext about games themselves – “We are conditioned to expect death and doom. We’re resigned to it. At its heart, this story is about that state of mind and how it effects the way we view our experiences, in games and in life. The Director’s Cut will feel either heroic or unnerving, depending on your own personal trust issues.”\",\n",

       "  \"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn is a first person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous creatures to ever exist – DINOSAURS. This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from 'pea-brained' dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. key Features: Hunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man – the Dinosaurs! Huge 3D Free-Roaming Open worlds. Beautiful and realistic high definition graphics. A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivorous (plant eating) to the Carnivorous (meat Eating). Realistic AI – Dinosaurs react to sight, sound and smell, each with their own mannerisms and Behaviors.

Animations and particle effects, tokens, and audio files can be used to immerse your players. It's a player, not a 3d map-building software. Both the demo and the full version contain only a few simple battle grids, so you will need the videos or static battle maps of Dynamic Dungeons or other creators. This software is in constant development, future updates will be free. Import Dynamic Dungeons maps or your own images or video files into the storyline and make a playlist, cover and reveal areas with the fog of war tool, apply custom size hex or quad grid overlay. Playing on the Tv screen is easier than you think. Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet-erase markers on it, so miniatures and dice rolls won't damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table with an HD projector. Please note, that it's not a VTT for online gaming. The Dynamic Dungeons Editor will help you to adjust the color of the videos and static maps, import png tokens to represent the players and their foes. You can play various ambient sounds and use particle effects to pimp up static or animated maps. A free modular dungeon pack is available for this software containing more than 100 png props like corridors and various chambers to build your own dungeon. (Although there are many customization options available and custom 2D maps can be created with the application, be aware that Dynamic Dungeons maps are not made with this app, but in various 3D software.

The more games you play in the world of online real money gaming, the more severely you feel you are bound, you feel right, you are almost all playing with a group of professional players who rely on a full suite of scientific tools to give real-time calculations and decision-making cues playing.

Without scientific calculation tools, in real money poker games, you have strategies and dare not use them. The essence of Texas Hold'em is a real mathematical probability game. Data and calculations determine the choice of strategies. In the past two years, the Texas Hold'em books handwritten by foreign professional players who have been translated by the player groups on Taobao are very expensive, far more expensive than my game. Those books cost hundreds of yuan, and they are still very popular. This marks that although the state strictly prohibits Texas games, players' pursuit of strategic knowledge has not stopped. They provided some foreign poker experience and strategies, and I provided a professional training ground and toolset that also filled the gaps for the Chinese in terms of Texas science tools. 3): Optics does not practice, it is natural to learn, and it is valuable to apply what you have learned. You don’t know whether you are cheating or not, and you don’t know why you win or lose. Basically, you are just playing for nothing. In this game, you can freely organize the table, freely set the blind level, freely set the hand range of each opponent, freely set the opponent's AI type, and freely set your own hand range, so that every time the card is dealt, the You're dealt hands in this range, and you're also free to set one of the 20 good hands, so there's a definite training. In the game, the various win rate data, listening win rate, and EV data of each player on each street are calculated in real time, saving you the trouble of manual calculation, and also giving you AI decision-making suggestions from professional-level textbooks. These ensure that you can train fully on demand. and judging whether it makes sense for you. The complete display of this information in the game also helps you analyze the game, so that you know the logic of your winning and losing, where you win and where you lose. Don't think that you lost, it was me who cheated, you can understand whether I cheated by reading the data and graphs carefully, you can't understand these, either you have no knowledge of technology and playing cards, or your understanding is too poor, what? It's all clear, you still can't understand it, and it's clear that you don't have the ability to think, and you can't play IQ games, so don't waste time torturing yourself. Tell you clearly: 1: I sell strategies and tools, and I show you professional strategies in the game. 2: The game is sold at a fixed price. Even if you lose all the chips and diamonds, the server will continue to supply chips and diamonds for you to play. There will be no extra charge. I don't need to cheat you for chips and diamonds at all. , I don't even bother with it. 3: The chips and diamonds provided are enough for you to play 50000 hands. You need about 500 hours to play them all. For the vast majority of players, they will not spend 500 hours on a certain game. They do not give you a huge amount. The chips and diamonds are also to bring you closer to the real world to play from small stacks, so that it makes sense. 4: It is not a multiplayer online crowd gambling game, but a console game, or more precisely, a training tool. The networking function ensures that you can freely share usage data between your mobile phone and computer. This game is more precisely a training tool and a tool for assisting actual combat calculation and strategy. I have provided you with a trainer aircraft and a fighter jet, and it is up to you to combine your wisdom, ability and financial resources to control and use it to assist you. If you think you want to train yourself and experience the brutality of professional gambling, then you can play hard. It provides you with the basic prerequisite knowledge, skill-strategy mix, training environment and toolsets you need from beginner to pro. As a poker tool, the existing functions have completely covered the calculation and decision-making functions of the whole process and all stages required for scientific training and real-time battles. At least it's completely enough for me. There is no longer any free on mobile: 1: Before the V4 version, a free google play version was provided for the convenience of steam players to download the mobile version for free, and for some users who were unwilling to pay to experience the function for free. The new version of V4 will be forced to upgrade from the beginning, and the old mobile phone version will not be able to log in. Old users who pay for it need to ask me for it. 2: Now I don't offer any free versions on all platforms. Now the computer and mobile phones have the same functions, and the google play also has the same price on steam. But you only need to buy the steam version, then you can send me a letter to ask for the corresponding android mobile version. When asking for the android version, you need to provide a screenshot of your purchase history on the steam platform to prove it. Just send me a screenshot of the purchase record information in the email. 3: All versions are unified as paid versions, and the price is the same, which ensures the rights and interests of paying players and the quality level of players. 4: On February 26, 2022, the new version of the server was updated to Alibaba Cloud, with 4 cores of 8G, 10M dedicated bandwidth, 80G cloud disk, and a 3-year lease, so the service for at least the next three years is guaranteed. If you are a streamer and have some fans, you are willing to play it, and willing to share and show this game to your fans, I am willing to provide you with some steam keys. Send me a letter with your platform and number of followers hits: In the battle mode, the range of each player is also shown to you graphically, and the player's hole cards are in the corresponding range. In the pc version, you can select a large resolution in the setting function, so that you can see the range map well in the game. And the most important thing is that it's the cheapest of its kind. manual： We welcome capable agent wholesalers from all over the world to sell the software, I provide retail steam keys in all regions of the world 100~500 steam keys, 30% off 500~1000 steam keys, 40% off 1000~2000 steam keys, 50% off The larger the wholesale quantity, the better the discount {LINK REMOVED} core function: 1: Click the function board card to set the community card, and click the hole card icon to set the hole card. 2: Different player types can be set, and each player has a different range of actions. These ranges also determine different action logics. 3: Equity calculator, draw equity calculator, EV calculator, real-time poker simulator tool. 4: Real-time poker simulator tool, this is the most important for online professional players, which greatly simplifies the time consumption of thinking and performing calculations. 5: Advisor (advisor) provides you with a standard play, the basic guarantee is not to lose money. 6: Before the action decision, provide the EV value of different actions and betsize. 7: Practice the advisor and action EV in the battle mode. Core value points: 1: Poker simulator tool: When playing poker online, professional players can display the complete mathematical data immediately after entering the opponent's range in real time according to the situation of the game table, saving users calculation time and energy, and providing standardized behavior suggestions. These real-time and accurate calculation data and standardized action suggestions help players make quick decisions. Value point: It saves the player's energy consumption in mathematical calculations in the game, and allows the player to invest more energy to focus on the accurate determination of the player's playing range and the use of real-time data to make decisions based on experience. Real-time display of all poker game data, which is not available in other tools. I combined the various data calculation functions scattered in multiple Texas poker calculation software into the real game. The player only needs to determine the opponent's range. In the simulator, Preflop and postflop are also purchased professional range action data, which can be set in the simulator: stacks deep, bet size, and player position to see the real-time advisor. Now this advisor is conservative. range data comes from rangeconverter.com/solution_formats/eight_max-MTT-Complete-Postflop-Addon-NEWOnlineViewer-yearly The core of the simulator is that you need to have the ability to judge the opponent's range of action. This is also one of the most basic and most important abilities of playing cards. If you don’t have the ability to display the range of Texas Hold'em at all, then you can use this tool to repeatedly play poker to familiarize yourself with the range. In the battle mode I provide the ability to display the range in real time. Let you clearly see how different people in different ranges play, and those actions are standard textbook play styles for professional players. Real-time display of complete data: The data standard provided comes from the result of 10,000 times Equity calculated by Monte Carlo method. In the battle mode with AI, you need to turn on the observer mode switch (observer) Data in the avatar frame: 1): EV: 0.70BB, indicating the EV data after the current operation. BB stands for the big blind value. 2): equity data for each street: 2r: 4; 12.93%. Format: 2r (to river equity, calculated to river street Equity): rank (in the current surviving players, own 2r Equity ranked); equity (own real-time 2r Equity, 2r Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the Equity data to River Street is calculated based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. nd: 1; 72.67%. Format: nd (next street equity, your own Equity on the next street): rank (ranked your own nd Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time nd Equity, nd Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the nd Equity data to the next street is calculated according to the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. cp: 1; 88.23%. cp (current street pure equity, the pure Equity of one's current street): rank (ranked of one's own cp Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time cp Equity, cp Equity calculated from your own perspective). Represents the calculated cp Equity data on the current street based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. Outs: 30, which indicates the number of draws made by players on that street. At this time, you can open the hands card strength information table, and you can see the probability of the current hole cards and board cards developing to various draws on each street. 1: In preflop and river street, showing 2r is enough. 2: On flop, turn street: displays the complete 2r, nd, cp data, and on flop, turn street, you can see the outs data of the player in that street at the same time. These real-time Equitys and draw data assist in determining the hole cards against other players' hole cards or ranges, their own hands card strength and winning ability, and help them make action decisions on various streets. The betsize window at the top of the interface shows the human player (self) under the current action menu, the EV value ranking of each action in the action menu, the leftmost is the best, and it decreases from left to right (if there is only the leftmost data, then it is According to EV evaluation, this action is the most appropriate, and other actions do not need to be considered). This is based on the action logic shown by the EV. This is also the EV data of each action calculated by the player himself before the action. (The EV data in the avatar range is the EV data after the action, and the meaning of the two is different). This 4-speed EV table of betsize is the data display for making decisions based on EV when displaying the street. In fact, EV has no absolute correct meaning in action guidance before and after the flop (preflop and postflop), and it is not correct to make decisions based on the positive and negative EV. Advisor (Advisor): Shows the decision in this street, comprehensively assessing the following content: player's hole cards, opponents' range or hole cards, current own 2r, nd, cp Equity data and Equity ranked, and the player's own position Table position, player's current stacks deep, current number of people remaining at the table, EV data of each action in the current menu, and bankroll management. The current advisors tend to be conservative, and the goal is to try not to lose money. Advisor also implements a standardized pre-flop strategy in preflop. Advisor also implemented the post-flop strategy suggested by rangeconverter.com in postflop. In the battle against AI mode, you need to turn on the advisor mode switch (observer). Click on the user's avatar to open the user's scope, view or set the scope. Click on the hole cards, you can open to view or set the hole cards. Click on the board card, you can open to view or set the board card. In the simulator, click the D icon to switch the position of the dealer. Click the gray D icon to reset the position of the dealer. Regarding range setting or selection: 1: Provides the standard range for various filling actions in the preflop stage. 2: Provide 24 kinds of action ranges commonly used by professional players. Each professional player divides all hole card combinations into 10 action groups. You can see the action ranges of tag, lag, rock, maniac, and nit players. 3: Provides a view of the opponent's mathematical action range based on the opponent's vpip and pfr. Vpip and pfr can view these two values \\u200b\\u200bof opponents from third-party statistical software licensed online, such as holdem manager 2. The graphical Equity calculator provides a complete and correct Equity calculation function. I provide complete toflop, toturn, toriver's montecarlo and Enum calculation methods. It has the same effect as Power-Equilab, and its own data is guaranteed to be correct. When Power-Equilab calculates toflop and toturn, the data is often incorrect (why it is not, you will know by playing with his montecarlo and Enum methods, the longer the calculation, the greater the deviation of the two data, which is wrong), But the calculation result of to river is correct. It sells for $40/year. It does not have a real-time calculation method in the game. It is not suitable for actual combat, but only for review calculations, lacking actual combat significance. PokerGenius: This provides draw data, and my draw ability calculation is the same as his. This one is from the University of Alberta in Canada, which is also one of the two most famous schools in the world that studies AI in Texas, and the other is cmu. It also provides equity calculations, but only with toriver capabilities. Moreover, neither the draw calculation nor the Equity calculation has the ability of real-time calculation in actual combat. You can only manually enter the calculation to see the result in the review. It sells for $70. The provided Equity calculator, draw calculator, and EV calculator are all to ensure that you know the correctness of the data calculation results and allow you to trust the correctness and stability of the function. The AI \\u200b\\u200bin the battle mode comes from the range of 24 professional players. You can conduct targeted range confrontation strategy training. 1): Various AIs and advisors use the same standard professional gameplay action logic. The difference from yours is only the hole cards and the action range. 2): 14 types of chip depths (10BB~100BB, 200BB) are provided (different medals will open different new chip depths, and different chip depths will have different playing methods). Because of the different chip depths, the card game will be played The strategy is completely different. 3): AI adopts the textbook style of professional players. You can understand the AI's action logic in thousands of matches, you can learn this action logic, and you can also find the corresponding exploiting AI logic. Repeated training can help you quickly identify the opponent's ability and the opponent's range. The functions of this V4 version basically cover the core functions in Snowie. As for the effect, you just need to compare it. I can only tell you the value for money. Ability matching is equivalent to Snowie 230 USD/year. If it is in Steam, there is no sound. 0: under \\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Solo King-Single Player Texas Holdem Poker\\\\Windows_Release, rename Windows_Release to Windows_Release1 1: Adjust your computer sound controller. 2: You can download the game from D:\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Solo King-Single Player Texas Holdem Poker\\\\Windows_Release Move another folder, and then click TexasHoldEmSingle.exe to have sound.\",\n",

       "  \"Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld. Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others.\",\n",

You step into the shoes of a hapless professional driver tasked with transporting various alcoholic beverages such as beer, spirits, wine and brandy to certain venues like birthdays and other miscellaneous celebrations. If you thought this mission will be easy, think again. The infrastructure will be challenging to say the least. Country roads, mountains and highways that resemble dirt roads will all prove to be worthy adversaries on your path towards a successful delivery. Abysmal roads aside, the biggest enemy will be your very own addiction to the booze you’re transporting. Potholes seem harmless after you’ve transformed into an insatiable drunkard which suddenly thinks that he’s got the off-road skills to take as many shortcuts as needed. The most inaccessible corners of the map no longer seem like obstacles. Really, what are YOU waiting for?

       "  'A ROOM BEYOND, is fantasy point and click adventure based on essential subjects of human existence. This novel game draws the drama around the “Fog Wanderer”, a murderous apparition scaring a small village in a Lovecraftian world. Help the villagers to solve the murder mystery and discover your own fate which seems to be oddly woven into the entire drama. A philosophical story is built upon inspiration coming from the book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying . Videogames such as Alone in the Dark 1 , The Last Door and the famous Lucas Arts games significantly influenced the general tone and coloring of the game, as well as the art of H.P. Lovecraft and E.A. Poe . The game’s innovative mix of pixelart and low-poly rendering has attracted a lot of interest among players and artists. Synopsis When you awake, you find yourself trapped in a gloomy cave. Dim candle light reveals strange symbols and cult objects all over this place. You can’t remember what happened, but this place gives you shivers. There is a tiny ray of light in the distance which might lead to a room beyond this darkness. Outside the cave you find yourself in a forest which is surrounded by deep gorges and thick layers of fog. A crowd of people lives here in fear of an ominous apparition that creeps through the fog for manhunt. Help the villagers to solve the mystery of the murderous fog wanderer and uncover the fate that brings you to this place. Gameplay Simplified control of the game can be learned fast and allows a quick start. No strong prior experiences with computer games are needed for playing A Room Beyond. All interactions can be accomplished by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer. The game does not define specific timing so that players can take their time to explore the virtual world. Additonal game features are unlocked gradually while progressing storyline. Technology &amp; Style 2.5D Perspective: The game’s visual perspective is known as 2.5D, which describes a combination of 3D effects in a general 2D stage design. Both types bring their own benefits to the game: Interaction and navigation is easy in a 2D scenery, but visual perception of depth is increased by using 3D objects. Pixel Style: Manual and procedural processing steps create a mosaic-like pixel effect which results in a graphical abstraction that increases the scope of visual interpretation and stimulates players’ imagination. Combination of both, smooth animations brought by modern technology and the look and feel of retro pixel game design leads to a fresh contemporary graphic style.',\n",

However, living in such a dark world can make one insane. The king and his creations have lived in this peaceful yet, disturbing world for ages but, those times are about to come to an end. The 'Realm Breaker' is about to shatter everyone's perspective of what 'reality' really is. Archimedes, a member of the 'Royal Seed' has embarked on creating a new world with characters using life-like A.I. The player characters he created are now the rulers of this world, but, in name only. Almost as soon as Archimedes gives them the kingdom, a strange abyss phenomena starts appearing all over the land. The ten heroes set out to save their world against this new threat. Meanwhile, in the Eternal Realm, Archimedes' project is sabotaged and now he and his friends are branded as traitors. Who is this unknown enemy lurking in the shadows? Why is he framing Archimedes? This game is part II of the 'Royal War Saga'. Part I of the game was a satire of the jrpg genre. Playing this game is helpful but not necessary to understand the story. Eternal Realm II takes on a more serious tone and develops the characters and story a great deal more. Important Characters: Warrior : Arrogant and self-proclaimed king of the realm Berserker : Stupid, naive, and friendly. Good at killing things with his ax. Sentine l: Always calm. Never says anything. Defender : Chivalrous and valiant. He always talks in capital letters. Hunter : Usually normal but, has multiple personalities Rogue : Lazy and sneaky. Just likes to chill. Ice Mage : Cowardly and shy. Flame Mage : Lunatic. Randomly says morbid things and like to burn things with his flames. Thunder Mage : Typical air-headed girl. Earth Mage : Scholarly individual that likes to use big words. Most find him boring. Archimedes : Creator of the guild; he has been branded a traitor by the king because of the 'Realm Breaker' incident. Balthasar, Chronos, Dinah : Archimedes' friends that assisted him in activating Realm Breaker. Eldrick, Nara, Merlock : Members of the Royal Seed sent out to capture Archimedes. Yarin : The eldest of the Royal Seed. He has lived for over 900 years. King Zerberus : King and creator of the Eternal Realm. He has ruled over this world for over 1000 years. Features: 2 difficulty modes (Normal and Easy) Free-Turn Stamina Battle System (mixture of SMT Nocturne and Chrono Cross) 10 playable characters Over 90 different enemy types Several optional mini-bosses Non-random encounters Full recovery after every battle Save anywhere 2 different endings The Free-turn Stamina battle system allows you to take 4 actions per turn. The actions can be divided up between the characters as you see fit as long as they have the stamina to carry out the action. Characters recover 30-40% of their stamina per turn and the 'Rest' command allows an extra 40% to be recovered. It's the same battle system from Eternal Realm but, now with more options, diversity of abilities, and a more balanced difficulty level. Now you can switch characters out during battles and change accessories to fit the situation. If you like a good rpg that actually makes you think during battles and isn't just 'mash x to continue' then this game is for you. Game controls: Z: Confirm / talk / open treasure chest X: Cancel / open menu Q and W: Scroll through character menus Left and right arrow keys (during battle): Switch characters Alt + Enter: Change to Full-screen Here is a link to the first Eternal Realm game for those interested: /\",\n",

Like most side-scrolling platform games, you control a character that runs across the screen, jumps, collects and avoid obstacles. Unlike any other platformer I know, you must shuffle the level itself to get all the fruits. This platforming game has a little twist because the level is divided into segments like a puzzle. Each piece can be swapped by another piece. Select two segments to swap them. A segment will be highlighted by a green border if you hover over them. When they are swapping they will exchange their position in the level. The levels come in different kind of sizes and are different cut in segments from each other. By rearranging the level the player can collect all fruits to progress to the next level. The obstacles you meet are spikes and walking and jumping enemies. Use moving platforms to your advantage and collect keys to activate blocks. Be sure to click the tutorial button if you don’t know how to play. The game contains 42 levels that will be harder as you progress. Achievements are included with each level. Swap two-level segments with the mouse by selecting them and they will swap.

A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.\",\n",

This game is a text-based adventure created with the intention of allowing the user to experience the frustration of being dyslexic. Sentences and words are made intentionally hard to read through different rules of how they are constructed change with every chapter, ranging from a flickering background, jittery letters and PQBS's being swapped around. Choices must be made in a quick time which leads to even more frustration. Much like a book, you could skip to the end of this game thought the chapter select menu but this is supposed to simulate the fact that you can do this but don't get any satisfaction from doing so. You can re-read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome. There are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on people's common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia. There is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat 'Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome'. And there is an option to change the font to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read. There are options which allow you to play the game in non-dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that. The game includes a range of accessibility settings.

       "  'Semi-Sweet Tofu is a 2D side scrolling platformer game where players have to eat fruit to survive along with using the color you change while eating the fruit to defeat the enemies you are faced with. We took things from other games and modified them such as “Don’t Starve” when you have to eat to survive and added another mechanic too that he fruit you eat to survive also give buffs to the player as well as useful to survive and progress. You have to jump on platforms and use certain fruit such as the apple which gives you a higher jump height to reach certain platforms or the banana fruit which gives you movement speed so you can jump further or run away from the magician. The core of the gameplay relies on the fruit and the ability to use them in a unique way. You can throw fruit at enemies to stun them as well as collide with them to destroy them. If you’re not the same color as the enemy you’ll take damage but if you are the same color you’ll destroy the enemy without taking damage.',\n",

We've even already forgotten how it all started, and where the roots of the terrible terror lie – the terror that swept across Europe in recent years. Syria is all over the news, and it's become a subject of many documentaries. We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word 'game' mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror. What kind of a game is it? Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers. The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness. Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign. Importantly enough, there are no «life bars» for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module. In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited. A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas). The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes. And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the ‘top’. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope.\",\n",

Your management style will determine the kind of quests you can take – as enemies are locks to students’ keys, fulfilling harder quests will require build specific rosters to solve these challenges. Plan, Forecast, Execute, Repeat Foresight and strategic turn-by-turn decisions are critical to succeed in our unique turn-based combat system. Built around class-based proficiencies and breaking enemy weaknesses, players are rewarded both for bringing an optimal team composition and taking calculated risks in combat. Whether playing it safe or taking the gung-ho way, it’s up to you how to solve the challenges presented. Manage a Dynamic Student Roster Despite the lure to focus on caring and honing just the best students, as a Principal it is your duty to ensure that every children taken under the wings of your academy thrive. Students will stay for only three years before they must graduate, and every one of them will affect your academy’s reputation (which will deter gifted students to enroll next year!). So manage your whole student roster well, as focusing on just a select few individuals may gimp you when they inevitably leave the school grounds, as you will be left with those less cared for.',\n",

Upgrade and build your roster of available Mechs from over 80 unique parts, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. From flamethrowers to mega missile pods, fighter drones to rayguns, determining the right Mech build and leveraging its weaponry is key to conserving your resources and defeating The Swarm. Mech Armada offers deep grid-based, turn-based combat, where there are no perfect solutions to the challenges you face. Understanding your enemy and anticipating their actions, getting to know the limitations of your Mechs while managing your resources and observing the terrain ahead of you will determine your success. At the end of each area, you’ll need to take on The Swarm’s major bosses: they're massive, ugly and ridiculously tough. Are you up to the task? No two runs in Mech Armada are the same. With procedurally generated levels set across a backdrop of varied post-apocalyptic environments, every element in the game is randomly combined and balanced to create a unique, challenging experience. Like all rogue-likes, death in Mech Armada means game over. You’ll need to try again with an entirely new run, with fresh Mechs and all new encounters. Wanting to try new tactics, Mech designs and strategies without risk? Head to the Sandbox, where you can pick any parts you want. Practice your maneuvers, experiment with unique loadouts and refine your strategies against The Swarm.\",\n",

It is a bilingual JPN/ENG game about translation and how it can run as deeply as the way hypermarginalized people constantly 'translate' their identities and trauma for the understanding of others, no matter how far it is from the source material. It's about recovering from trauma through the genuine compassion and consideration of another person, who manages to See the aftereffects of trauma and are willing to meet that person's unique needs, regardless of if they 'understand' them or not. ════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════ Hanashiro (he/she/they) and their few remaining kin all react differently to the trauma of being immortal and witnessing the apocalypse over and over again in different cycles of reincarnation. Shiragiku is unfazed and cheery and flippant and whimsical and capricious; Shirayuri is nowhere to be found; and Hanashiro? Hanashiro is planning on their death in 10 years, when the camellias fall, if they cannot find a reason to live by then. Hanashiro and Shirayuri have witnessed THE END OF THE WORLD before. But no one believed them. Shiragiku has seen many, many apocalypses, but she has never been hurt by any one after the first. Shiragiku has remembered every single end; Shirayuri has remembered none; and Hanashiro only remembers some. Which? Even he doesn't know. Hanashiro misses speaking her fey mother tongue, but she can't seem to find anyone willing to listen to her, not even her own kind. And then she makes an enemy who just might. Their name is Lun Kochouran. And they might be the first one in a millennium to learn the Amayuri tongue. They also might be the first to kill an immortal. ════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════ Ochitsubaki is only loosely a visual novel, which is to say it is a story-based game with a strong aesthetic component. Ochitsubaki has a deep, rich tapestry of aesthetics in unifying modern elegance with unique retro anime-inspired character portraits. The original soundtrack derives inspiration from traditional Asian pentatonic scales, particularly but not limited to Japanese ones, that also derive a modern, Genshin's Liyue-type twist that sets it firmly in contemporary times. It has three language options: JPN, ENG, and JPN translation. The ENG/JPN versions are two different renditions of the story, thus requiring a separate JPN translation, emulating what happens when you try to translate something as complex as identity. You can consider that the only real choice you make in the game is which language to play it in, and each language option provides a different 'route,' a similar but very distinctly different iteration of the story. The language modes mimic the powerful loss that happens when stories--when trauma--is translated.\",\n",

Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours.

Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it.

The game is divided in 2 main interfaces : a worldmap view and a regional view. Each world tile matches a unique procedurally generated isometric zone that can be explored, settled and built on by players. In each one players can find random resources such as ores , animals or plants depending on the climate, relief and vegetation of the region. Features Pigs with clothes. Multiplayer on local or persistent servers. Complex socio-economic simulator for a challenging city-building experience on its own. Technological evolution with hundreds to techs, from the stone age to post-iron age. Fully procedural worlds where each region is random and unique. 7 biomes, each one with its own specific resources to encourage player-trading. Advanced diplomatic and economic tools to setup treaties ( right of passage, taxes, payments, trade agreements... ) and trade routes between players. Real-time battles. WILL remain free of any pay-to-win . Economy No direct control over population and economy: They breed, age, work and buy things according to the simulation. Population divided in social classes with specific incomes, purchasing power and revenues. Dynamic resources prices based on supply/demand, rarity and production costs. Even player consumed resources are taken into account: materials for buildings have to be bough at their market prices, generating incomes to the producers and affecting the economy. A simulator instead of a set of independent game rules : all variables and actions influence each other in sometimes unpredictable ways that makes things frustratingly challenging. Producing too much of something can be as damaging as not enough making the logic of the game quite different from classic management games. ( ex: instead of having positive effects, distributing a new resource can actually destabilize your economy if you're not careful ) Military Real-time battles are not instantiated and actually take place in your cities. Build and customize your fortifications with walls, bridges, gates, stairs, towers and battlements. With the terrain tools, modify the terrain heights to take maximum advantage of natural defenses like cliffs and hill tops. Water forces troops to embark and cross with slow vulnerable rafts: dig canals around your forts, secure your bridges or build a citadel on a river-island with fortified bridges. A Strategic-tool allows players to design their local defensive strategy in each one of their cities in case of attack: creating defensive zones, setting troops initial deployment positions and setting their behavior in battle. Battles are not instantaneous and belligerents can send reinforcements while a battle is still in progress. Battles can include unlimited 'teams' at the same time, each one fighting according to its allegiances. Battle troops during a battle are all AI controlled ( so that battles can happen independently of the player's presence ). Dozens of unit types including mounted camels, elephants and armored mammoths. Main game modes Real-time mode : a 'classical' mode to be played alone or with a few friends, meant to be played with the permanent presence of all players and to be stopped/continued over several playing sessions. Persistent mode : a more 'MMO' mode where the game server is to be left running 24/7 at all times even when players are offline and where actions take much more time than in the real-time mode. Meant to be played with the maximum number of players on a day-to-day basis, with games lasting several weeks. IMPORTANT This game is a one-man project: development is slow. This game is likely to forever remain an experimental work-in-progress and to never reach the quality, stability and optimization of a finished product: buy it only if you think it's worth it NOW, and not based on future expectations. Playing solo is possible, but the main focus of this game is multiplayer. The game is available in more languages than English, but localization is done by the community and might be partial and incomplete.\",\n",

       "  \"Do 'Win'! 'Win by Definition' is a one-player card game adventure. The card games you've been playing are probably that you have to try to reduce the opponent's HP/LP or collect some points to win. Sometimes you may be a bit tired of bogus rules and incomprehensible effect processing. But this game is quite different. Run the card which has the effect 'win' below, or that's all. you will be born as a role of a subspace in a world where nothing should have existed and explore for what you are. The goal [/] In a card game, you do everything that is written on the card. Draw cards, send them to the graveyard area, exile things ... that's not all. You even need a card to enter some stages and move around the world. Sometimes you will get and own cards, for battle others. Define the victory, and challenge every way for the victory. Features [/] Unquestionable gameplay [/] It's very difficult to explain how this game works. If I say 'You use one card. Repeat this.', It may be an explanation of the rules. The most remarkable feature of this game is its simplicity. What to draw each turn, how many cards to draw, where you draw from, even where is the hand, how can you win for, are there opponents, and what are your live points, even is there a status of 'life point' ? Everything is undefined until a stage starts. Example of Card effects [/] Here are just a sort of 5% of the effects used in the game. 「Card A」を1枚手札に加える．(Add 1 'Card A' to your hand.) 手札を100枚捨てる．(Put 100 cards in your hand into the graveyard.) 「ライフポイント」を2にする．(Set your 'life point' to 2.) 墓地が30枚以上なら，勝つ．(If you have 30 or more graveyards, you win.) 「手札の1枚」を手札に加える．(Add one of your 'one of your hand' to your hand. it's not one of your hand but a card named 'one of your hand'.) 「墓地」は「手札」を意味する．('Cemetery' means 'hand'.) 「song.ogg」を再生する．(Play 'song.ogg'.) 背景をギザギザにする． (bold the background with the tile of 'gizagiza (=jagged)'.) 場を非公開情報にする．(Make 'the field' private information that you can't see.)[/] from the developer [/] So, for the first time, my name is Toorun12. It's for the first time we have developed a game. The content is, sort of a 'mysterious adventure'. It would be great if you could re-recognize what should be 'win' and what is the best thing we call literally 'card game' after a mysterious experience through out this.\",\n",

What awaits them at their destination, however, is not the holiday they had planned. Their time away is soon spoiled by news of recent kidnappings and graves being robbed. To make matters worse, these crimes are alleged to have been committed by a dark elf. Keen to investigate these incidents, Sable and Lisha move from town to town as they encounter one shocking revelation after another: mind control, forbidden magic, a human town where magic is the norm, and another side to her father's past which Lisha knew nothing about. With all of the chaos going on around them, is a tender moment between man and elf too much to wish for?

       "  'X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support. Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore. Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. The core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle! Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It’s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down. Features Super accurate flight characteristics using a virtual wind tunnel Includes 30 aircraft, from gliders to the Space Shuttle Online flying with other virtual pilots Air Traffic Control actually controls the other aircraft around you Accurate terrain, roads and more Global ‘Plausible World’ auto generated scenery New rendering engine with innovative global lighting 64 Bit optimized Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come) Includes super-detailed scenery for Nice (LFMN), Paderborn-Lippstadt (EDLP) and Faro (LPFR) printed “Quick Start Guide” included Default Scenery Having installed the software via Steam you only have the main simulator as well as the Seattle region.

The twist is, instead of directly controlling the characters IN THE BATTLE, you will be designing the strategies BEFORE THE BATTLE. When the battle begins, your units will follow exactly the strategy you defined, and all you can do then is just watching. Different challenges are presented in different levels. One strategy won't be able to defeat them all. You'll need to learn, adapt then conquer. Developer Note: This is my first game on Steam and I did this by myself. I wanted to avoid popular genres and do something different. Since this type of gameplay isn't popular, the game experience might be somewhat clunky. It's OK if you don't like the game and want to leave a bad review, but do leave your thoughts so that I could make this game better!\",\n",

Players need to constantly plan and build labyrinths to delay the advance of waves of monsters hitting the fortress. Well-planned firepower is also essential. Rely on the powerful attack ability of different gem combinations to destroy the monsters who 'please enter the urn' and successfully defend your fortress. 2. Basic gameplay operation: Challenge several waves of invaders, with increasing blood volume and increasing difficulty. 1. Place 5 random gems in each wave, choose one of them to stay after the placement is over, the other gems will be turned into stones, which can be used as a maze. 2. If 2 of the 5 gems placed are the same, you can upgrade a gem with a higher level, and if there are 4 identical gems, you can upgrade a gem with a higher level of 2. 3. If any of the 5 gems placed this time directly meet the special synthesis, click any of the gems to perform the special synthesis. 4. After the placement is over, if there are gems on the map that meet the special synthesis requirements, click any of the gems to perform special synthesis. 5. After the placement is over, select the reserved gems to perform downgrade operations to facilitate the synthesis of special gems. 6. Press the space bar to quickly place and retain. Third, the type attribute of the tower: 1. Basic tower: It is the tower that can appear in each round, divided into eight types and six levels 2. Synthesis tower: a tower that can only be synthesized by formula 3. Stone slabs: Towers that can only be synthesized through recipes (can only be placed and synthesized this time) 4. Star tower: obtained by super-synthesis of the same gems after reservation (the highest three-star, cannot participate in the synthesis) 5. Evolution Tower: The synthesized gems evolve by consuming gold coins (with the highest level and more than one line evolution) 4、 Promotional activities Four, Promotional activities: Steam new users can get 1000 diamond gift packs and send emails to: rangergame@163.com , you can receive the reply of the newcomer's gift bag code.

Last one standing wins. ** This game is LOCAL only! ** Additional Content: The game features 20 challenges, each of which will test your skills and agility.

This game showcases the revolutionary Freedom Locomotion System that provides you with a wide range of options, which will allow you to find the most immersive fit regardless of how motion sickness sensitive you might be. The Freedom Locomotion System puts CAOTS (Controller Assisted On The Spot) at the front and center of the system. This is a form of walking in place locomotion solution where to move, you simply walk, jog or run on the spot, allowing you to walk, jog or run in VR. This also has the benefit of allowing you to traverse large open world VR spaces in an immersive manner while been less likely to get motion sick than traditional sliding VR locomotion solutions. For those that prefer a less active solution, or are still susceptible to motion sickness even while walking on the spot, the system provides Dash and Blink steps that are derived from teleportation schemes that have been proven effective in not causing motion sickness. Any way you choose, you'll find that you can get around the various large scale environments in an immersive manner that helps you feel as though you were really there. The primary goal of Freedom Locomotion VR is to provide a proof of concept demo to show that VR is very capable of taking advantage of immersive large scale environments along with many of the game play norms that we've become accustomed to in traditional games.\",\n",

       "  \"About Kinetic Void Kinetic Void is a 3D space adventure with a focus on customization and exploration. The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours. A New Galaxy Every Time. Procedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode. Know Your Neighbors. In Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings. Fully Detailed and customizable Space Ships. Tailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel. Freedom to Choose Your Fate. Be the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed. Intense Active Combat. Target enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship. Take Direct Control Of Your Ship. Kinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through mouse movements. Control your battleship’s turrets from a sweeping orbital camera or slip between asteroids in a dogfight while piloting your heavy-fighter using mouse flight mode. Switch between modes at any time to best suit the situation. Key Features Fully detailed and customizable space ships Hundreds of weapons and modules of multiple sizes Huge procedurally generated galaxy, limited only by your computer's capabilities Randomized factions and political standings Open world sandbox, you are in control of your fate Detailed economy simulation with resources, trade routes Epic space combat\",\n",

Off-center patterns become lovely, simply by tapping either the horizontal or vertical mirror buttons. The entrancing visuals are backed up by a chill soundtrack, with different tunes available.

There has been a long term conflict between the Ettaze and Trettaze states since the time when the Ettaze ruler decided to accept the fact that the human beings had the rights to co-exist with the demons in the Ettaze state where the majority of the state were the demons. This was the kind gesture of the ruler who gave the human beings the equal opportunities to join the universities and have a working career in the state even when some demons had a notion of looking down upon the humans. Under the leadership of Gabbon, the Ettaze ruler, the humans and demons learned to co-exist with each other which the ruler of Trettaze state could never accept. The ruler of the Trettaze state started to attack them in every possible way, banning imports and exports, barring tourists from the state to enter the territory etc. This had led to a war breaking out between the two states. However, Trettaze was the first one to officially declare the war against the Ettaze and threatened to kill all of the humans and the demons of the state. The ruler of the Ettaze had a hunch that a war between the states would break out anytime. He hired the best warriors of the state, the team of the three Demon Girls called Tri-Demon Girls who were said to be the strongest team of warriors in the state, in order to eliminate the intruders at all costs. Meanwhile, Emiko, the granddaughter of the Ettaze ruler, decided to step in at her own will and helped out the Tri-Demon girls team in her own way in order to protect the state against the intruders. Even as a half-demon she had a strong will and determination to achieve something big. Emiko with her own 'Devil Weapon' begins her journey to defeat the enemies, and to become the best warrior in the state and abroad. You play as Emiko and your mission is to fight against the enemies in order to protect the weak. Key Features: 15 Levels to play! Different kinds of enemies including three-headed monster! Lots of deadly traps and obstacles to overcome! 3 Firing modes which include regular, laser and Plasma modes. Ability to freeze the enemies and double jump! Story Driven! Difficult situations and hard to master! Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, programming, designing except for the music.

Over 180 unique models were reimagined so you can explore your metropolis like never before. Transforming the 2D world into 3D has limitations and things that just aren't feasible. These design limitations have been solved by studying 3D Maxis games of the early 90s which made use of the SC2 map file format. Please note this program is not endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise affiliated with Maxis or Electronic Arts and all assets (code and graphics) are original works. What game engine are you using? SC2KRender is an open-source project written using DirectX 11 and C++17, it does not use a game engine. A stripped-down version of DirectX ToolKit was used, which is a collection of helper classes and functions for DirectX. Some features of this homebrew include multisampling anti-aliasing, frustum culling, and Direct2D/DirectWrite integration for text rendering. How can I create my own maps? You will need to legally obtain a copy of SCURK or WinSCURK to create maps, or purchase SimCity 2000™ and either load in your saved map or use the included copy of SCURK which comes with it. The Team: Aleksander Krimsky: Programming and Art Thomas Nelson: Lead Artist Various people who have helped along the way are included in the source files available on GitHub. Accomplished Decompress and parse map data Render water, terrain, and building data Fullscreen, borderless, and windowed mode Steam release Future Plans Textures for terrain and models Lighting with day and night modes Render underground data (tunnels, pipes) Link power lines Tentative/Stretch Goals Simulation with cars, boats, planes, etc. Support for AR/VR Help Section Why do objects 'flicker' for me? This can be due to MSAA struggling with some geometries on buildings that use triangular faces, try turning off MSAA to see if the issue is fixed. I will be looking into finding a more permanent fix in the future. Why do objects still 'flicker' for me? This could be due to z-fighting if your camera is very far away from the scene. Try zooming into the scene and see if the issue is resolved. The problem may take a bit more effort to try and resolve. Why is this thing so damn laggy? The map size is 128 * 128 = 16384 possible models, not counting 'scenery' objects. Frustum culling is a feature that prevents rendering objects that are not within your camera, so try going more to the ground-level of a city for better fps. Unfortunately the pipeline for graphics rendering is largely single threaded with the exception of 'command lists' which is an NVidia only-feature. What are you going to do about the performance? The current goal is to work on a technique known as instancing, that should help performance a lot.\",\n",

       "  \"“Sedo” is the world between living and dead. If you want to get back alive, catch all the straw figures. Howver, you must not be found by the children of the Angel of Death. SEDOMAIRI is a first-person action horror game where you escape from a randomly generated world that looks like an old Japanese house. You have a radio. The radio enables you to detect the distance and direction of enemies and figures. Use the radio to collect all the straw figures while hiding from the enemy, the children of the Angel of Death, and try to get back alive from the 'Sedo'. Gameplay built for fear The distance of the player's lights, the distance of footsteps, the distance of the enemy's vision, and the distance at which the radio can detect the enemy are all calculated and set to make you fearful. This ensures that you will always have the fear that they might be right there. Randomly generated maps This game generates maps with more randomness than my previous game, 'Infection Maze'. Therefore, you can enjoy fresh play even after repeating the game. In addition, a custom mode is included. You can customize the size of the map, the number of enemies, and other aspects of the gameplay by yourself. Battery management for items The items the player has are a light and a radio. Both are essential for exploring the map, but they have batteries that need to be recharged within a certain period of time. It makes you feel tense. The atmosphere of a Japanese house 30 years ago I created this art model with the atmosphere of a Japanese house 30 years ago in mind, which only a Japanese author can create.

They battle against the other or team up against the garbage drones living in the junkyard. The randomness and unpredictable nature of the game makes every round into a new challenge, because you always have a new ship to battle with, raising the stakes and making the game quite addictive. Key Features Creativity under time pressure mixed with action-packed spaceship battles. Deathmatch until only one player remains. A new ship is constructed each round.

       "  \"/ / There the story's hero makes a stop to embark on a quest of treasure hunting, discovering ancient artifacts in a broad variety of locations across the world – from Europe to Japan to Egypt. The Traveler is quite an exceptional character, not only because of his daring and curious personality, but also owing to his unique special power. He can slow down time to a halt and resume it at will! This ability will come in handy as Timerunner's main mechanic; you can use it to your advantage in a variety of ways – dispatching opponents, moving through the game's world, and solving puzzles, among others. Beware though – time manipulation is no easy feat and you have only so much energy at your disposal. If you run out, you will have no choice but to release time back into its natural flow and face whatever awaits you in it! But things are not as we know them on the Blue Planet. Strange forces appear to be in place that make the days on our world as different from its nights as, well, night and day! Daytime appears to be the domain of civilization, a time to tackle the modern forces of the human military, understandably feverish to get their hands on a powerful alien and stand in his way. After sunset, the world seems to be ruled by the creations of human imagination. Centaurs, ogres, phoenixes, and even dragons emerge from the darkness to oppose the Alien Traveler. To what end? How do they come to be? Some of these questions will be addressed as the hunter pursues his prizes. Apart from his ability to stop time, the Alien Traveler relies on his adventurous instincts and quickly adapts weapons secured on Earth to his needs – whether it's a pistol, revolver, shotgun, assault rifle, or a rocket launcher. Combined with his time manipulation skills, each of these can display some incredible results on the battlefield, an advantage the Traveler will need to make use of when facing overwhelming odds from diverse enemies with their own array of unique abilities. Even if it seems like time is on your side, be sure to think fast!\",\n",

Do you play defensively with the spear and energy shield, or swing into the fray with a boomerang and grapple hook?

'What Gamepads are compatible?” Currently Xbox and Xbox 360 controllers though other Xinput controllers may work. NOTE: Not natively compatible with Playstation controllers yet. Keyboard and mouse works just as well. Is there much of a story in game? There's minimal story exposition as of the current build. We do plan on integrating a loose narrative as development progresses though... “I'm running the game on an old computer, how can I make it run faster?” Please see the following forum thread on optimization : “Where can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?” Please look to the forums, we check messages there each day. Feedback is welcome and there are some excellent community members who are willing to help to. 'Anything else to be aware of?' Default gamepad controls are slightly different from convention, due to optional 360 degree aiming with right analogue stick. Though buttons can be rebound to suit. It’s designed to be challenging, and death may be encountered frequently during your initial runs. Though there is no stunlocking/one-hit demises on the player. Being able to multi-task between abilities will greatly increase survivability. **The game has a steeper learning curve than the average platformer, particularly in the first 25 minutes Every challenge has multiple solutions For example, if there is a chest on the other side of a lava pit; do you...? Grapple across Bend time and bounce off enemies Use a boomerang to fetch the item Blow up the pit with a grenade; setting everything nearby alight! ... More Features Over 80 unique enemies and traps 12+ randomized level themes. Such include tidal corridors filled with mines, rising lava, caverns lined with toxic and carnivorous plants... 4+ Primary world types (grotto, gardens, temple, cold crust caverns) each with their own traps, enemies, boss and special theme layouts. A plethora of creative abilities ranging from parkour to cloaking to warping time itself! Every object has multiple uses E.g. you can grab that lantern from the ceiling, and carry it around to use as a portable light source or improvised flaming molotov... Hand crafted pixel art and animations Regular updates A unique musical score. Customize character skin and clothing colors. Permanent progression: allows you to unlock world shortcuts, new items, character backgrounds... So much more...

Developer Commentary: Last year I began learning how to program, it was something I had always wanted to do. I used the Twine Interactive Fiction Engine to experiment and learn. I started off with simple tests, which eventually evolved into large games: A train game, where you were stuck on a train and you could shovel coal and drink tea and look out the window at the random scenery selected for that day. It was quite zen. I also created a game based on Edgar Alan Poe's, 'The Raven.' It was an educational game that sought to take a really long poem and dissect it with comics, gifs, and mini-games. People liked it, and I had a fun time dressing up ravens in various costumes for it. Those games were more art than game according to the community. That was a fair opinion, the mechanics were as limited as my knowledge. I wasn't satisfied to just create art though. I wanted to make a game that was unmistakably a game. I set a goal, I was going to make a 100+ level game with maps and mechanics and puzzles. I wasn't going to take a whole decade either, I made an effort to work on it every day, even if I was tired so that I could someday finish it. At first I didn't even know how to make a map. Then I discovered arrays and how to use them. It was magical seeing my character walk around on the map I put together. I spent all day at work coming up with theories as to how I could implement the various features I wanted to put in the game. Errors. Errors. Constant errors. I'd spend all day just trying to get one thing to work. My determination paid off and the mechanics I kept hammering at started to work. Usually at that point they were clunky and flawed. I'd end up completely re-doing them, but I didn't mind, every error was a chance to learn better techniques. I hope that the love put into the game makes it all the more enjoyable to play.\",\n",

But the more you drink — the harder the game gets. The survival of the human race now rests on the last southern family who knows how to make the whiskey moonshine — the McCrearys — a bunch of permadrunk, bootlegging rednecks who all dislike each other. They must now get home to the Louisiana swampland and their illegal moonshine still — to save humanity. There will be comedy and action mixed together with suspense and nail-biting moments that could easily turn into a screaming, button-mashing frenzy. You can play solo or grab some friends and create some whiskey-fueled zombie-mayhem together in local multiplayer . And if someone turns zombie, all it takes is a bottle of whiskey to bring them back.

Not drunk enough and the virus creeps up, impacting your stamina and, of course, might turn you into a zombie.

The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel. Key Features: Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic. Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked).

This simulation covers the entire Circle Line in its current operational service which includes the new section to Hammersmith. This line offers a length of 27km with 35 stations, many hours of fun and interesting missions The Circle Line is an underground service of the London Underground circling the center of London. It was first described as such in 1949 and already appeared on the 1947 Underground Map. It had not been built as a separate line, but was merged from different sections of the Metropolitan Line and the District Line. Only two short sections of this line are solely used by the Circle line. These sections are the connecting curves between the stations of High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road and between Aldgate and Tower Hill. Features 3D - Cockpit with rotatable camera Original virtual reproductions of 35 stations on the Circle Line Free movement in the train and at the stations (accomplished for the first time ever!) More realistic AI trains, dynamic passengers on the platforms Superb graphics, reflecting headlights, night effects Realistic announcements recorded exclusively by the original speaker Tube map Physics The physics have been developed based on real values, such as those used in training simulators. The driving and braking characteristics of the trains are reproduced faithfully and reflect the feeling to actually controlling a train of the London Underground. Graphics Compared to the first two products in this series, Vol. 3 uses a new 3D engine. The simulator is now based on the Vision Engine Trinigy, which made it possible to substantially improve lighting and 3D effects. At the same time the stability and performance of the 3D engine has been improved.\",\n",

Cultivation Tales has two game modes: PVE and PVP. In PVE mode, players must cultivate immortals cooperatively because they are not allowed to invade other factions. But in PVP mode, you can invade other players’ factions and plunder their resources, putting everyone against one another. This mode is full of challenges, and it will conclude at the end of the battle season. When you wake up in the Four Quadrant Array, you realize you are in a chaotic land full of fantastic creatures and merciless monsters. You are bare-handed and defenseless. In order to survive in this mystery land, you must learn how to build tools, acquire resources, and make equipment and goods. One person isn’t enough – work together with your friends to build your own faction and make it stronger or join other factions if you like. Forge some powerful weapons to hunt those ancient creatures and monsters, explore this wide and mysterious land, find the truth behind it, and make your own stories. Labyrinth Territory Labyrinth territories are dangerous places with full of random puzzles and mysterious creatures. You can hunt mysterious creatures and find treasure boxes to obtain rare materials for forging equipment. Cooking systems can help you cook food to increase your strength, and the plant materials you collect on the ground can be refined to make useful medicine. Remember to use the Arcane Altar when you beat a level in the labyrinth territory. Players can get random abilities to become more and more powerful - sooner or later they will be strong enough to challenge the Lord of Labyrinth. These abilities are too powerful to control so they can only be used in this territory. Be very careful, as some undead left their belongings in this territory. If you are scared and in danger, remember to use the teleport stones to escape. To Survive Food and water are essential for survival. There are many different kinds of food in this land, all with different effects when eaten. Consuming uncertain food may bring negative effects, so be careful. All actions consume water and food, and long-distance travel will consume those items continually. There are many factors to determine how you can survive in this world, but day and night cycles and weather conditions are some of the most important. Make sure to make some suitable clothing, expand and enhance your factions, build shelters, and use fire to protect yourself from the harsh and changing environment. Create Factions Logging, Mining, Collecting, Hunting, and Becoming a Master. Use your crafting abilities, worktable, forging table, grinding table, handiwork shelf, and other tools to improve your skills and create more complex and powerful items to fight against enemies and protect yourself. Use the construction hammer to build your base and improve your base functions. Use everything you can to make the greatest and strongest faction possible. Battle System You can choose your weapons from more than 10 different weapon types, in addition to countless types of equipment to protect you from head to toes. Besides physical weapons, magic instruments and magic stones can cast elemental attacks. Use each attack method and enjoy the fun and dynamic battle system. To explore the world, walking is not the only option: you can dodge, stand on your sword to fly, run on the water, swim, and even feign death. These skills can help you gather materials more efficiently and help you fight those formidable monsters. Master the real fighting arts - increase your stamina, magic power, dodge, parry, and counterattack and become the greatest warrior in this land. Guild System When people gather together, there may be some conflict. As a Guild Master, you need to manage your faction well. Unite each member, work together, and conquer the mysterious ancient world. Oh, almost forgot - before that, make sure to give your faction a cool name.',\n",

CHARACTERS Rena is a sweet funny girl that is serious when it comes down to business. She is pretty short, but despite that, nothing scares her and she can talk back to anyone. The girl only teases the people that mean something to her and that's what happens with the protagonist too. She has a great business and is one of the best talents regarding potions, but never brags about it. The girl knows that people don't take her seriously because of her looks, but she managed to show them how imposing she is by her hard work. Sana is a elf warrior but that's not what her whole personality revolves around. Despite her stern look, she is a person that values life more than anything and thinks it is better to retreat sometimes from fights and try again than to die a hero. She is a smart, strong woman that has some love for humans and other people, despite them being against her kind. She knows Rena and that helps her trust the mc more since he came from her. Georgia is a strong woman, both physically and mentally. She leads a bunch of men in her blacksmith shop and doesn't respond to anyone. She is a very important person and the best in the town, making weapons and armors for the king and people close to him. She lost a close friend in a battle but doesn't tell anyone about it. Since then, she swore to not participate anymore in these sorts of things. Although she makes items that kill people, she doesn't see all battles as something that should never exist but more like a necessary evil. Angami is a strong but weird naga warrior. She has to watch over the MC but despite that being an inconvenience for her, she barely complains about it. She has to train the recruits all over the kingdom and despite her tough look, she loves to joke around and tease, especially with people close to her. The woman is older than the mc by twelve years but no one else knows that about her. She started this by helping Georgia, but warmed up to the protagonist and even bring him food from her place. Yuna is a cheeky succubus that only hunts the best guys in the town. Despite her sexy attitude, she is overwhelmed by the MC's kindness and falls in love for the first time in her long life. She is made to attract people so that was never a problem for her, so she can't explain how the protagonist managed to refuse her advances in the first night. She is almost never serious, but gets interested in what humans do and even cooks for the mc as a gesture of gratitude. Yuna tries to tease the protagonist but always falls short, getting embarrassed and ending up being the one that gets teased more.

       "  \"NOTE: This game is very unfinished and is free for you to enjoy because we thought what is there was fun and worth you being able to tinker with. We make no claim that this is a complete experience. It was a passion project for Chris, and a lot of time was poured into this, and we wanted to let you faff about with it. If you leave a review, then reviewing it based on what it actually is (a freebie tech demo) is appreciated. Be a raptor, feel like one, and smash robots to bits. Procedurally-assembled 3D environments set in a scenic futuristic dystopia. Free release of an aborted Early Access title. We hope you enjoy it! Note that this is an AS-IS release, based on popular demand, rather than us taking it down completely. Sell Me The Idea In One Sentence If I have to convince you why being any form of dromaeosaurid is freaking awesome, then I'm not sure we can be friends. This game is carefully crafted to give you the closest possible feeling of being one of these glorious monsters -- then turning you loose to do fun stuff. What’s The Point? 1. For the pure fun of the thing. In 1993, a certain game let you be a raptor. The controls were iffy. The levels were short and static. It's very dated. Yet many of us still dust it off periodically -- just to be a raptor. Release Raptor gives you a far more satisfying, modern, dynamic experience. 2. For a power trip. For speedrunning and finesse, you're on an invincible rampage. It's not about IF you can do it, but how WELL you do it. Your performance is evaluated, so mistakes still have consequences without interrupting the flow of the game. 3. To play with kids. I want to be able to play this with my 5 year old son, but still have dismemberment (because that's cool). How to do that without blood or gore? Robots! Little robots = pouncing targets; giant mechs = dismemberment targets. Procedural Assembly What on earth do we mean by 'procedurally-assembled?' Basically, we're using a very heavy mix of handcrafted content with procedural bits making it fresh each time. Creating unique and recognizable areas is a huge focus, because otherwise you get unimaginative 'procgen blandness.' Yuck! But we still wanted that sense of exploration, and so not chunk of level is present in every run, the layouts of the overall level (and where enemies are as well) varies quite a bit. NB: Yes, we know that’s not a velociraptor (and there should be feathers).\",\n",

REVIEWS Upload VR: Winner of 2021 Upload Awards - Hidden Gem. Mare is a breathless beauty of a VR game – simplistic in its progression perhaps but never anything less than astonishing to take in. The VR Grid: It’s not about the destination, but the journey as they say, and Mare is one helluva journey. From the opening moments of the game, all the way to it’s conclusion, I was enamored by the presentation and the story. Mare is nothing short of breathtaking and a welcome change of pace to the to action-packed, fast-paced titles I have been playing of late. Its a strikingly beautiful yet solemn adventure that pushes you ever forward toward the unknown. 6DOF Reviews: Mare is a title I can easily recommend to anybody who has an appreciation for beauty and mystery. It evokes a mood unlike any I’ve experienced in VR.. It may be brief, but its impact will far outlive its duration, proving beyond a doubt that it’s the quality of our experiences that matter, and not their duration. Mare is a class act from start to finish. It's a macabre and mysterious adventure that offers a haunting experience that long outlives its light puzzles and relatively brief playtime. VR Focus: A puzzle experience with beautiful scenery and a mysterious plotline all about a girl who needs your help. The barren environment coupled with the superb musical score ensures Mare has an ambience and soul few VR projects achieve.\",\n",

Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet™: Extreme Condition, the landmark third-person shooter which debuted on Xbox 360 and went on to sell over 2.3 million units worldwide after its release. Lost Planet 2 offers deeper insight into the world of E.D.N III and the uncertain fate of future mankind. Already acclaimed for its visual accomplishments from the console versions, Lost Planet 2 will define the 3D experience on the PC. Stunning environments will immerse the player in NVIDIA Vision Surround technology, and the rebalanced gameplay and streamlined control mechanics make Lost Planet 2 PC the ultimate Lost Planet experience. A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Mankind has engaged in a civil war to take control of the precious Thermal Energy that powers weapons and vehicles on E.D.N. III and resulted in a separation into various factions. Players will control heroes from each faction across 6 interconnected episodes, viewing the war from the perspective of each, creating a truly unique interactive experience. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players’ perspectives. The intense and action-packed campaign mode comes with the ability to form teams of up to 4 players online. Beyond the deep single-player and co-op modes, Lost Planet 2 is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes allowing up to 16 players to compete online, each with their own customizable avatar. No action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and Lost Planet 2 has a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. The grappling hooks that made the gameplay in Lost Planet a true 3-D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by moving to elevated locations quickly. Lost Planet 2’s biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are VS that transform into other vehicles, hold up to three players and some that even take multiple players to operate. Key Features: Co-op action: Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4 player online co-operative play. Teamwork is the player’s key to victory as the team is dependent on each other to succeed and survive. Massive scale of enemies: Players skill on the battlefield and ability to work as a team will be tested like never before against the giant Akrid. Players will utilize teamwork tactics, new weapons and a variety of vital suits (VS) to fight these larger-than-life bosses. Beautiful massive environments: Capcom’s advanced graphics engine, MT Framework 2.0, and DirectX 11 support will bring the game to life with the next step in 3D fidelity and performance. See Lost Planet 2’s world through new eyes, with support for hardware tessellation and compute shader. Deep level of character customization: Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look, nom de guerre, emotes, and weapons to truly help them define their character on the battlefield.

Fearing for his sovereignty, contacts a secret corporation for the development of biological weapons of mass destruction, with name - Zero Experimental Establishment or ZEE. The project is allocated funds and a place of development - a remote corner of the country - the Montib island, cut off from the world, with a small population and no modern infrastructure. The deafening success of experiments is comparable only with the fundamental failure of the all development. The next monthly report says about the fall of a helicopter with samples of biological weapons on the island. And a week later, after reports of the observation - of infection of local residents, communication with the employees of the corporation, and indeed with anyone in general, disappears. The government makes a decision in secret from the world community and, despite the protests of the residents of the country who have relatives there, cut off the entire Montib island from the external world, and under pressure forces ZEE to investigate what happened. Despite the military patrolling the sea around the island and the likelihood of dying from the virus, the flow of people trying to get there is not running out. Someone wants to find relatives and friends, help residents, and someone wants to take possession of the abandoned property of a corporation or just have fun in a place where the laws no longer work. Why are you there - you decide. The release version of the game will include: - We have a huge map 20 by 20 kilometers, to reach the other end you need at least an hour and a half, with villages, cities and military bases - The map contains areas of summer, autumn and winter, with different air temperatures - Spawn is located along the entire southern coast (no respawns in the center of the map near military bases with top loot!) - Two factions. Marauders and Hunters (players will be divided into two factions, depending on their actions. Marauders will be those who kill players, Hunters - who kill bots and marauders. Each faction will have its own camp with a store) - Extraction of resources, from the simplest tree to valuable gold (gold will be a currency that can be exchanged for some things) - Transport with physics close to real, with repairs and refueling (one or two helicopters per server, which will not be easy to assemble) - Crafting and cooking (such dishes as ukha or mushroom soup will give an hourly buff of one or another characteristic, so cooking makes sense) - Building bases (wood - stone - metal) - Missions (missions will appear on the map, simulating various situations)',\n",

Beings living here discovered a miraculous power, which was, at first, small, and then grew large enough to move the world. The power transformed into 'mana,' a force that could only be handled by a chosen few, to whom it was entrusted.

However, some things have been forgotten over the long period of peace. An immense and dangerous power. The temptation of the dark side that even sees destruction as worthwhile, depending on how the power is used. Behind the convenient, gentle witchcraft used by all, is this dark temptation that has never disappeared.

More than 200 years had passed since colonization on Mars had begun. A slow process of terraformation had begun, occurring in the atmosphere and modifying its chemical composition. Despite the rarefied air and radiation, millions of people inhabited the planet. Mars was exploited for its mineral resources, but it served above all to reach the moons of Jupiter. In 2437, a new mineral called Ixenio was discovered on those moons. Ixenio was known to be indestructible over time, the hardest of hardest metals and able to generate an incredible quantity of energy through exposure to photon beams... it was the new black gold. In 2512, Mars was aware that it had become a superpower and it took advantage of the conflict between the Euro America League and the Asiatic Union to form and declare the Independent Martian Kingdom, I.M.K. The Asiatic Union sided with the I.M.K. while the Euro American League still claimed its own rights. All out war was, by then, at the door... The I.M.K. suddenly attacked Moon Base, using the asteroid fortress Abraxis as its logistic base. It conquered Moon Base and exploited it to send troops on Earth in support of the Asiatic Union. It was the beginning of Interplanetary War I. Key Features: Action Shooter with a tactical approach. 360 degree shooting system. More than 16 level: fight on earth and in space. Unlock 17 weapons as you play the game. Survive in large scale battles.\",\n",

The Game also features many Side and Challenge Missions to unlock more customization choices, like BluePrints with let you craft new/different Items. Turn-Based Strategy: Combat is Turn-Based and seperates in to stages, the Planning Phase and the Combat Phase . Planning Phase: Unlike in 'most' Turn-based Strategy Games, you have to plan more than just on 'action/attack'. This means each turn you have to plan multiple 'actions/attacks“ for each of your Units should make that turn, before you enter the Combat Phase. Units/Characters can make more than one action/attack each turn which can make a turn quite complex/difficult to plan. Combat Phase: If you are finished/satisfied with you Planning Phase you will end your turn starting the Combat Phase. During the combat Phase you have no way to change you desisions and all Units/Characters will take turns to activate and use 'actions/attacks“ until all activations are resolved and the next turn start. Customize your Characters: Every playable Character can spent upto 10 level in upto 4 Classes (you can mix/combine Classes to suit your strategy). Classes can have a level beween 0 and 5, unlocking Skills and/or Passives with each level. Every Character can equip atleast one Weapon, two consumable Items and one Artifacts. While completing Missions/the Story you will also be able to choose between rewards to permanently alter/enthance your Characters. Example Character: For this example we will take a look at the Character Elysa , who is a Water Spirit that joins the party in Chapter 1.

First we will spende 8 Classlevel (Chapter 2) , 5 in the Enhancer Class and 3 in the Cleric Class . This will unlock these Skills (black) and Passives (grey) . For the Weapon we equip [Tome: Chilling Storm] which grants her the [Chilling Storm] Skill without using the Hydromancer Class. As an Artefact we will use [Unholy Arsenal] with has a passive that grants 2 additional Skillslots, with is a perfect for a support Character with many support Skills. As consumable Item we equipen a [Mana Potion] and [Ironskin Potion] (to increase her weak physical defence) . For the last step we have to choose with Skill we want to equip on her Skillslots. Every Character can choose upto 5 Skills, but thanks to the [Unholy Arsenal] (Artifact) we can equip 7 Skills (8 if we count the Weapon Skill) . Our Skill choices are: [Holy Smite] a basic holy attack spell. [Divine Plea] a holy healing spell. [Purge] a spell to remove magical effects. [Imbue Power] a buff spell that increases damage done.

In the 24th century, humanity comes to be dominated by 3 interstellar mega-corporations after a galaxy-wide economic collapse. Humanity had enjoyed a golden age for over 250 years, where things like war, disease, and poverty were considered a relic of the past. The galaxy is now divided into major regions, the industrialized core systems controlled by the mega-corporations, and thousands of small colonies that make up the frontier. The mega-corporations use mass consumerism to keep the core systems population in check, which requires a continuous flow of resources from the frontier, which in turn creates a conflict between the corporations and colonies over the resources on the colony's planet.

More Than Your Regular Shooter You start with your own vehicle on a wild starting block with your online opponents and you must be the last one to survive. GangV has a strong emphasis on high-speed chases in the middle of the traffic featuring many different cars but also planes, boats, and helicopters! The game will require your shooter skills as well as your pilot skills for you to be victorious! But be careful, you start with just a gun and your own car may be quickly spotted by your opponents! Steal Your Loot You’ll have to Steal money and equipment from civilians that will call law enforcement on you. The businesses you rob will not only bring you money but also become part of your gang’s territory. This turf war has a huge impact on the Battle Royale as it allows you to put pressure on your rivals, especially at the end of the game as businesses allow you to buy medicine and ammunition. Fight and Run Away From Law Enforcement Depending on your previous actions (heists, murders, …), you’ll have to fight policemen, SWAT, or militaries but you can’t keep on the fight against them forever, you will have to run away and hide from them to focus again on killing your opponents. Hide In the Crowd There is nothing differentiating you from a civilian. That means you can hide in the crowd and in the traffic to find and take your opponents by surprise. But be careful as any civilian could also be a player hiding!

In some ways it is closer to a board game than an RPG. There isn't much plot or exploration in Rift Wizard- just epic wizard battles and deep buildcraft from start to finish.

He’s also critically acclaimed for his singles 'Sofi Needs A Ladder', 'Ghosts 'n' Stuff' and 'I Remember”. deadmau5 kindly allowed the use of his tracks “Polaris”, “4Ware', “GG” and 'Three pound chicken wing' to be part of the soundtrack of this game. Features Satirical pixel-art run and gun side-scrolling action platformer. Inspired by the classic arcade hit Ghosts'n Goblins. Set in a parallel universe in which the music scene is being dominated by fake DJ’s. 3 stages, 5 different enemies, walking and flying enemy behaviors, and one final boss. 4 regular weapons + deadmau5 head as armor and super weapon. 4 levels of difficulty for beginners and ultra hard core players. Super fast and fluid action gameplay. CRT filter for arcade feel. FX sounds based on 8 bit YM2203 and MOS6581 sound chips. Fully created by the house music legend Dr. Kucho! Featuring deadmau5.\",\n",

The denizens' obliviousness to their own terrifying past weakened the chains of the prison containing the Demon King, until one day they finally broke. The Chaos awakened and the horrifying nightmares of the forgotten past came back to life. He was once more known to every inhabitant of the land – child, adult and elderly alike. He sowed fear in the hearts of the brave, as an inevitable war came along with him. Those who could fight did, and fell. Those who were not strong enough to fight were possessed by demonic energy. The Chaos left no warrior's body alone and absorbed it into his army. Leaving no hostages behind, he incorporated inhabitants across all social classes and sorts, from lowly beggars to the noblest lords. His power grew to be so unimaginable that no mortal could stand against it. As a final resort, the Last Ones, monks of the Forgotten Monastery who still have a memory of what once happened, performed the ritual of summoning to bring back from the spirit world our Hero who sealed away the Chaos in the distant past. You play as the Ghost, the summoned Spirit of the Prince of the Kingdom of Midra, wandering your land. Passing through your kingdom's villages, forests and marshes, you'll have to defeat and possess your foes to acquire their skills and adapt your combat style to different circumstances. Each defeated enemy is an opportunity for a body with better chance of survival.\",\n",

Up to four players spend a minute and a half converting as many crowd members to their colour. this is done by moving their wave with 4 directional keys. Crowd Control was created in the New Zealand Kiwi Jam 2019 game jam. I created this game in under 48 hours. It won 2nd Place in the Christchurch Kiwi Jam Awards 2019 so i decided to publish it on steam. I made it free to play because It has a short gameplay loop like most game jam games. Summary The Mexican wave: an effect resembling a moving wave produced by successive sections of the crowd in a stadium standing up, raising their arms, lowering them, and sitting down again. Four players each control an area where crowd members feel the need to party! These people somehow change the colour of their shirts, jump up, and cheer loud noises. Each time someone jumps while wearing your coloured shirt your score increases by one. The team with the highest score wins. You cannot convert crowd members that have recently jumped (indicated by the colour fading over time). If you get cut off by other player's recent jumpers you have to navigate back to the last place you colour jumped and continue the wave another direction. Throughout the duration of the game players can find party people that are indicated by the small light green arrow above their heads. Party people send a shock wave of jumpers out in every direction but watch out as occasionally it might not be your colour of wave. To change the AI to player ratio you can left click on a player while the game is paused to toggle the AI. Controls Press Space, Escape or Enter to start &amp; pause game. Press F1 to restart game.

I will try my best to target latency issues to improve the quality of online gameplay the best I can. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend letting the game develop more before trying it out. There are YouTube videos of gameplay showing the current state of the game. Remnants has been solely developed by myself and I've always taken passion in working on it, I feel this is important to mention, so those considering purchasing Early Access can make a more informed decision. Goals of the project: The aim was to create a game that wasn't overly complicated but also provided a strategy-based experience that offered challenges and an overall goal and purpose to playing, rather than just looting and shooting. I wanted the game to be as balanced as possible in PvP while also offering decent PvE content. Remnants requires an internet connection to authenticate to steam!\",\n",

PLAY ALONE IN THE DARK AT 3AM FOR THE FULL EFFECT! CAN YOU GET ALEX OUT OF THIS FREE-ROAM OFFICE BUILDING BY 4AM? Alex is a social media live-streamer who is doing a livestream at a notorious toy factory office building situated close to his home. The building has been abandoned since the late 90's after 15 workers were found dead inside. Other companies have purchased the site over the years, but every time they try and renovate the building, the construction workers walk out and refuse to go back in. And so it's been left to rot. Take control of Alex, and try and find some answers. Once inside the building, he is trapped, and only has an hour to escape. Can you get him out in time and complete the 3AM Challenge? THIS IS NOT YOUR NORMAL HORROR CLICHE GAME WHERE YOU HAVE A CRAPPY FLICKERING FLASHLIGHT TO DEAL WITH! Due to Alex being a Live-Streamer, he uses modern technology to light his scene - a video light! This illuminates the room pretty well. And don't worry, you won't be hunting batteries either! This game goes for realism, and Alex knows how to prepare for his live streams! 😉 His batteries are charged and you'll either complete the game or die before his battery does! This game was inspired by Urban Exploring YouTuber's that go to abandoned buildings at 3AM to do, what's now known as, the '3AM Challenge'. As we all may know, 3AM is known as the devils hour, and is when paranormal activity is at its highest. Give it a try... IF YOU DARE!\",\n",

       "  \"Enjoy getting 'legless' with friends? Well, now you can cut each other's arms and legs off as you've always dreamed! Unlike 'proper' games, Endless Knight lets you continue to fight even after you have become separated from your limbs. Sadly the game does not permit the battle to continue after your friends actual death, for 'technical' reasons. Murdered and humiliated all your friends? That's okay, it happens to us all. Lucky for you, Endless Knight also features a not entirely 'tacked-on' single player experience, complete with an absurd story and songs! Slaughtered your way through the wonderfully crafted story mode? Take on the challenging but probably not impossible 'Final Fifty' mode for the ultimate climax of murderous satisfaction. Mmmmmmm. Completed 'Final Fifty'? Oh no, that's pretty much all there is. The mechanics of Endless Knight are different from what you’d find in most fighting games. There are no combos or 'special moves'. The focus is on reaction based blocking, as failure to block will have dire consequences. Due to this alternative focus, Endless Knight might take a few minutes to adapt to, but we hope that once you get the gist, you will love it as much as we do! Played alone or with friends, mastering Endless Knight can be jolly good fun!\",\n",
